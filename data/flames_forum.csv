Normally it's about how the team is going to ruin Wolf or Pelttier(sp?) Needs to have a good season or he is gone. What are your opinions.

I feel Conroy is doing alright. The team will no do well this year, the reason too many newbies that need NHL experience and not enough good veterans to help them out. This will be a learning year so they can work to be a contending team. As teams with so many veterans will learn that in the end they"
"Mobiandi","Aug 5, 2024","Unprecedented amounts of suck. If we break 60 points, I’d be surprised"
"FLAMESFAN","Aug 6, 2024","It's not going to be pretty, but I'd rather it right outright suck than just be bad and miss the playoffs by a point.
And shame on any fan unwilling to stick thru the bad times...I was around in the haydays (no, not 2004) and stayed a fan thru the dark days. Just have to have a physical team, beat up a few guys - small victories.
It's going to be all about the future, and that is what this site was created for. Try checking out the Hlinka/Gretzky, U18's, WJC and get a glimpse of some of the great talent available in the next couple drafts. I'm pumped for that."
"DomBarr","Aug 6, 2024","my thoughts are by the end of this season the only player left from the 2021/22 NHL Roster will be Backlund."

"","Aug 6, 2024","What's Facebook? 


This will not be a good season for the Flames in the standings. 

Success looks like the young guys progressing, maybe have someone like Zary take a full time centre role. This is likely to be overlooked by a casual fan who's only looking for wins."
"Roadrage","Aug 6, 2024","Enough points to finish bottom 5...so based on last season, no more then 76 points."
"Volica","Aug 6, 2024","This team will likely have a hard time breaking 70 points, probably lower than that... especially at the deadline when a bunch of vets are like ""I don't want to do this anymore.""

For the 'I don't cheer for losses' crowd. This is going to be a long ass season for you."
"SaintMorose","Aug 6, 2024","Still have both the Sharks and Ducks in our division, could see them propelling us past a a couple teams"
"Backlund","Aug 6, 2024","We're going to be terrible and we should be, but drafting Hagens is worth having to watch a shitty season."
"","Aug 6, 2024","I'm looking forward to the 2025, 2026, and 2027 drafts. With the right management, superb drafting, and a little bit of luck, the Flames organization can build a real cup contender."
"Yepthatsme","Aug 6, 2024","It’s an extremely weird group to say this about, but I think this season comes down to 3 players: Miromanov, Bahl, and Wolf.

The offense year over in theory should be much better. Last years Kuzmenko was a better producer than last years Lindholm. Last years Mantha was a much, much better producer (pre-trade) than Mangiapane, and in theory Coronato has more offensive potential than Pospisil. Zary’s a year older, and in 2024 Kadri was point per game + and Huberdeau started to regain some of his offense. It’s stopping goals that will be the problem, which is where those aforementioned 3 come in.

Miromanov gets slept on a lot here. He, like Kylington, missed over a year of hockey before coming back, and his first game with us was his 10th in any league since coming back. The Miromanov we saw last year likely wasn’t the Miromanov we see this year, and he wasn’t bad at all last year.

Bahl is interesting, because he has stretches where he would be a force but he struggled putting it all together. He’s still young for a defenseman, and players with his size profile usually take longer to develop. Our organization and especially Huska excel at developing defenseman, so I have high hopes for him.

Wolf needs no introduction. A typical season for a goalie his age would be stretches where he flashes his potential, but also stretches where he’s very beatable. Nothing is typical though about the level of dominance he’s showed in every other league up to the NHL, so who knows what he shows next season.

If those 3 take steps forward, I think we won’t be nearly as bad as people are hoping for. Not a playoff team, but we’d have to sell a lot of players if we don’t want our pick transferring. If they don’t step up at all from their play last year, we may legitimately be #1 in GA."
"DFF","Aug 6, 2024","Top lottery pick baby"
"Boomstick","Aug 7, 2024","I definitely don't have high expectations, but we do have some hockey players out there, and I'll be watching every game, whether we're good, or not so good.
I'm sure we'll be drafting Top 10 again, wouldn't mind winning a lottery though.
Looking forward to our future core in a few years."
"Khrox","Aug 7, 2024","I mean, I don't cheer for losses, but I'm not mad at them if the team actually tries/plays like they give a shit. Win or lose, I care more about the work ethic, especially going into a rebuild."
"","Aug 7, 2024","The Flames will be as good as you in the 1st goal game"
"","Aug 7, 2024","this. we get that wins will be more rare, so it's more about effort. the team was organically bad and have only moved 2 guys with any term... Mangiapane was moved from a position of strength, and Markstrom was a really good return that would have been foolish to decline.

as for what I predict...

Our goal prevention is gonna be really bad. We were tied for 10th worst in the league last year and that was with Markstrom plaing well and 50-ish games of Tanev, Hanifin and Lindholm; our best D pair and best defensive foryward.... it might get ugly, really ugly"
"","Aug 7, 2024","A year to cheer for individual successes rather than team ones, I imagine.

Stay the course Conroy."
"Bounces R Way","Aug 7, 2024","Probably start pretty well and then fall to pieces I imagine. I'm excited to watch some of the youth progress. Not all that convinced we finish bottom 5 but certainly possible, especially if we see some more vets moved out."
"BobColesNasalCavity","Aug 7, 2024","Continue the disappointment by surprising everyone by their compete and then of course barely miss the playoffs for a 10-15 draft pick."
"","Aug 8, 2024","I'm pretty confident we will finish bottom 5. I look at it like this... 

We finished tied for 8th-10th worst in 2023-24, that was with a full season of Markstrom and Mangiapane, 50-60 games of Lindholm, Tanev & Hanifin; as well as Kylington and Zadorov combined. 

We're replacing Tanev w/ Bahl... Hanifin w/ Miromanov... Kylington/Zadorov w/ Bean... Mangiapane w/ Mantha... Lindholm w/ Kuzmenko... Markstrom w/ Wold and more games from Vladar...

Then I look at the teams that finished around us and below us in the standings... 

Buffalo hs Byram for a full season while adding Zucker and McLeod... but their season depends more on Cozens and Thompson bouncing back and internal growth of Power... are they still a bad team? or was 2023-24 a down year after being close to a playoff spot in 2022-23? I personally think they will be better.

New Jersey.... healthy Hamilton, addressed goaltending by adding Markstrom and Allen... they also added Pesce... like Buffalo was 2023-24 a blip on the radar after a much better 2022-23 where they were one of the better teams in the league? I think the reality is somewhere in teh middle, but I think they are a playoff team.

Seattle... another team in the same boat as Buffalo and New Jersey, bad 2023-24 after a good 2022-23... are the additions of Stephenson & Montour going to be enough to get Seattle back into the playoff race? I don't know, but I think at worst they'll maintain their level of play.

Ottawa... Chychrun, Tarasenko and the terrible Korpisalo out... Ullmark, Jensen & Perron in... Pinto will be around the full season... it's hard to imagine they will be worse simply via goaltending alone.

Utah... it's hard to believe they won't improve after adding Sergachev & Marino to their blueline and only subtracting Moser from the 2023-24 roster in teh deals. Thy should challenge for a playoff spot.

Montreal... they be bad, but I don't think they got worse.

Columbus... their ""big"" adds were Severson & Monahan... but their season depends more on the growth if their kids.... I think they improve slightly due to internal growth. 

Anaheim.... I have the pegged as the worst team in the NHL this season. Not necessarily worse than 2023-24, but certainly not improved, while San Jose and Chicago took strides to improve.

Chicago... a healthy Hall and adding Bertuzzi and TT upfront will help Bedard take a step forward... adding Brodie and Martinez n the blueline will add some stability so it's not just on Jones and Murphy.... and Brossoit should be a decent improvement on Soderblom who will get to start in Rockford where he should have been last year. They will definitely be improved, maybe enough that with our step back that they could pass us.

San Jose.... they added some experience in Toffoli, Wennberg and Goodrow to help insulate Celebrini... they're still not going to be good. Probably only better than Anaheim.

Looking at those teams, as well as Philly, Minnesota, Pittsburgh, Washington and St. Louis... I legitimately think we could very easily finish bottom"
"FLAMESFAN","Aug 8, 2024","We've seen less talented teams get close to the playoffs, so I wouldn't be surprised if we over achieve.
A couple key injuries though, and I could see us close to bottom 5."
"Bounces R Way","Aug 8, 2024","You make some very good points. There is quite a few bottom half teams that should be better, even if only marginally. 

Maybe it's the trauma talking but I could see a future where the Flames are hovering around a playoff spot into February. There are some proud vets on this team, and plenty of younger guys with something to prove. Losing Lindholm, Hanifin, Zadorov(miss you 4eva Zaddy), Markstrom and Tanev definitely makes us worse on paper but we weren't really anything special with them either. Will they stay or will they go was a big distraction for the team during the first half of the season. I don't see any more such situations looming for the locker room. 

I also feel our offense goes a little under the radar, Kuzmenko really helped the PP click into gear when he came over. Huberdeau I'm not sure what we're going to see but wouldn't surprise me to see him show up motivated and focused having watched his former team and the guy he was traded for lift the Cup this summer. Our blueline and goaltending is getting a lot younger so there's going to be some shootout games. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm hoping for a top 5 pick because a franchise 1C is a must for this rebuild to have legs and the 2025 draft looks like it might have a couple of em. Just don't think it's a given at all."
"","Aug 8, 2024","Simply put, I don't think we have the horses on the back end to insulate Wolf and Vladar. We're looking at some combination of Bahl, Bean and Miro in our top 4. Offense is the least of my concerns. I think we could finish in the 13-17 range in GF, but I'm expecting us to be one of, if not the worst defensive team in the league, we were already tied for 10th worst in GA last year, I fully expect our GA/GP to rise by about half a goal a game, to the 3.75 range."
"Volica","Aug 8, 2024","Just a note, rarely have one-way offensive wingers ever been the difference between playoffs and not on bad teams.
Our defence is going to be atrocious this year. Really there are two top 4 guys on the entire roster and a bunch of question marks. Would it be awesome if Bahl and Bean turn into something good? Absolutely, is it likely? Probably not.

I like to do an if's game. General rule is the more if's the less likely a team is to be good.

So for the Flames to make the playoffs it would require:
If Huberdeau has a recovered/motivated season.
If Kuzy plays at the same level from the end of last year, through the whole year.
If Shango can replicate last year
If Coleman can replicate last season.
If Mantha finds chemistry with Huberdeau or on the roster.
If Wolf gives us essentially a Vezina caliber season.
If there's no drop off to Kadri's game.
If there's no sophomore slump for any of the returning rookies.
If Bean can be a dependable bottom pair guy.
If Bahl can develop into a good middle pair guy.
If Miramanov ends up being an offensive catalyst on the PP.

You compare that to like the Avs, and it's like:
If the team stays healthy.
If goaltending doesn't fall apart.

I don't think they'll be record-low bad. But I could see them winning 4/10 games; 65/66 point pace. They won 7 games of their last 18 after all their trades last year. That's 46 point pace. I think it'll be better than that, but not much."
"Mobiandi","Aug 8, 2024","The only reason they may start well is because there are no expectations on them to challenege for the playoffs. This team tends to go opposite what they should. But they are definitely finishing bottom 2 in the conference"
"herashak","Aug 8, 2024","Likely a properly executed Simone Biles of suck"
"Yepthatsme","Aug 8, 2024","Nobody is unseating Chicago and San Jose from that throne. We also talk about how terrible our defense group is this year, but Anaheims is actually terrifyingly poor, and their forward core is just wall to wall youth which while entertaining is usually a recipe for disaster.

Think we’d be about 4-5 player trades off our roster to have a chance to break into that top 3. Chicago’s second best forward this year is Teravainen, San Jose best defenseman is a race between Ferraro and Walman, and Anaheim is rolling it back with the same group. All 3 were bottom 3 in both GF and GA (with the exception of Chicago allowing only the 4th most goals), that’s a level of suck we don’t have to sneak into that bad of a territory this year.

Unless we dump Andersson, Coleman, Kuzmenko, Mantha, and Backlund early ish in the year, I think we’ll be hard pressed to be worse than any of those 3, Montreal, and Columbus. I feel like it’ll be a tight race between us, Philly, Ottawa (won’t believe in them until it happens), Utah and Washington for the 6-10 range."
"Ledge And Dairy","Aug 8, 2024","Great in-depth write up here. A couple notes though:

- New Jersey is probably going to rocket into the top 5 team range. Besides goaltending and the Dougie injury what really held them back was the size on their blue line. Sure they lost Bahl's 6'6 fram but they swapped out a 6'1 181lb Marino for a 6'3 205 lb Pesce, while also adding a 6'4 225 lb Dillon. Also worth noting that Hughes and Nemec will both be sophomores now, and not rookies playing 20+ minutes a night.

- Columbus added Severson last summer. Agree that their success is mostly on internal growth.

- Seattle was plagued by consistently having 2 key player or another on LTIR last year, they were almost never playing at full strength. But when they were they went on like 7+ game winning streaks. 

- I think you are ignoring Anaheim's internal growth. There are a lot of high potential young players on that roster, especially with the addition of Gauthier. They will still probably be bad but mostly due to the same reason as us, poor defending. 

- Chicago actually has a formidable D-core. Alex Vlasic was statistically the best defensive dman in the league last year and Korchinski is going to take another step. Not to mention Del Mastro is knocking at the door. 

- San Jose also added Will Smith so they will probably score a lot more. However their D-core is still the worst in the league so they will also let in a bunch of goals. I still expect them to finish last, just not with less that 50 points again. I think they will be closer to 60"
"","Aug 8, 2024","Hot take: Wolf having a Vezina caliber season is all that is needed."
"Bounces R Way","Aug 8, 2024","Historically you're definitely right, young bluelines and young goaltenders do give up a lot of goals. I expect that to be the case. There's still quite a few bluelines in worse shape than ours though and if there is some chemistry in the fwd group they might be able to keep up in those 5-4 games. The Bahl pickup I liked, really lacked that physical presence as soon as Zad was traded. Miromanov I just don't have a great read on yet, thought he played some good games and some poor ones when he got here. He hasn't played a ton of hockey in the last cpl seasons and a full offseason training healthy should give us a better indication of what we have with him. 


It was for the 2014-15 Flames. 



I'm not at all saying they're going to be good and make the playoffs. Way too many ifs certainly. 
Mostly just not seeing the no doubt bottom 5 roster many pundits and posters have labeled them. Think another 6-12 overall pick is more likely."
"Tkachuk Norris","Aug 9, 2024","We lost 3 of our 4 best 5 on 5 and PK guys (Hanifin, Lindholm, Tanev). I don’t think people realize how much that Hanifin Tanev pairing carried this team last year. We had the easiest schedule in the NHL after the trade deadline and got demolished. 

Our PP is abysmal but likely probably gets slightly better, cause how can it be worse. 

Markstrom had a really strong year. 

This team is going to be bad. Only way they aren’t bottom 5 is if we see Wolf play like Saros (I think there will be an adjustment there as he gets used to NHL shots, he’s not a blocker, and there will be some struggles). 

The only teams worse than us right now are Chicago and SJ in my mind. Maybe the Habs. Maybe a team like Pittsburgh or NYI stink it up. 

I like Huska but it’s going to be tough sledding."
"RasmusAndersson","Aug 10, 2024","Imo many fans got so caught up debating retool vs. rebuild and whether we should’ve gotten marginally better returns for some of our players that they missed the bigger picture—Conroy made it a priority to focus on youth, add lots of draft capital, not overspend in FA, and sacrifice some short-term success for long-term gains. He clearly has his eyes towards the future, regardless of whether we finish 31st or 25th this year. 

We may not agree with every move or be completely satisfied with every return, but he’s moving us in the right direction for the first time in a long time.

Of course it all comes down to the next few drafts and finding that legit 1C, but I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: in Conroy I trust."

"DomBarr","Aug 12, 2024","you are looking at the odds wrong...its the odds are against anyone BUT those 3 franchises getting a franchise altering/saving megastar."
"Ledge And Dairy","Aug 12, 2024","I kind of get it. When you have superstars you throw all your draft capital and the kitchen sink to keep the team competitive as long as possible. And because you generally have success with said star players, any picks you do keep generally don't amount to much at all. Eventually those stars will retire or leave and your team will plummet to the bottom of the league with no good upcoming prospects to fill roles so your odds of drafting high are very realistic."
"Some Other Flame","Aug 16, 2024","Let's see, a very one-dimensional forward group overfilled with middling veterans, a terribly inexperienced and questionable defence, and completely unproven goaltending. Put together that's a clear cut bottom 10 team no question. And given just how bad the defence is on paper, one could easily say bottom 5. 

But since this is the Flames, it can only mean this group is going to wildly over achieve by making the playoffs and losing in the 1st round theryeby ruining everything. Parekh's will make the team out of training camp and put up 40+ points, Huberdeau decides now is the time to start scoring putting up 80+, while Vladar returning from injury plays like a vezina candidate. 

Seriously though, it really looks like Conroy is deliberately aiming for a top 5 pick. He's built a team that's should be entertaining offensively but awful defensively, which is exactly what you want in the early stages of a rebuild."
"The Gnome","Aug 23, 2024","My thoughts for the Season...Load up on your favorite whisky or bourbon cause you'll want to forget this season even happened. It's going to be far uglier than most people can stomach.

"Double Dion","Aug 23, 2024","I really want to see us using the season to figure out some things. Presently I have these questions about the roster that I want to see answered this season:

1. Is Zary a center or a wing?
2. Is Pospisil a center or a wing?
3. Is Miramanov a project that is worth investing in?
4. Is Pelletier something or nothing?
5. Which of our defense first guys (Kuznetsov, Solovyov, Bahl, Grushnikov) are able to do that in the NHL?
6. Is there a market where we can get real value for one of Coleman or Kadri?

We aren't going to know which of our offensive D are potential stars this season, but we can half-way know if we have the goalie. I don't need to see Kevin Rooney trotted out as our 4C with Lomberg and Duehr. I want to see if Pospisil can be our 4C with Lomberg and Pelletier. I have zero use for a traditional veteran 4th line."
"Ledge And Dairy","Aug 23, 2024","Agree on most of this, though I think we should also figure out our plan with Ras. A year ago I considered him untradable and a must re-sign. Now with Parekh, Brzustewicz, and Mews as our RD depth I'm leaning towards dangling him for more picks/prospects (I look at Nashville's 3 1sts and top 10 prospect pool and think he would be a good fit there as well as they have the assets, for example). 

Also I want them to try Pelletier with Backs and Coleman."
"herashak","Aug 24, 2024","If it gets ugly I think shipping out Andersson will be the right move. Guaranteed top 10 pick (setup for Mckenna) and even more cap space"
"Double Dion","Aug 24, 2024","Agreed on Pelletier. For me Andersson is already clear. I'm moving him. He's too inconsistent. Some 40 game stretches he looks like a #1 and some he looks like a #4. I'd rather keep Weegar as the show the way vet."
"Boomstick","Aug 24, 2024","I'm hoping Pelletier and Coronato have huge camps.
Not sure I want Duehr and Rooney playing over them two.
But we've got too many forwards. Conroy should maybe make a move or two to open spots for Pelts and Coronato."
"","Aug 24, 2024","Rooney is a C, I don't think he'll be relevant to their playing time. Whether or not the team sees Zary or Pospisil will be where Rooney fits in, if yes to either he likely sits in the pressbox."
"joescores","Aug 25, 2024","Completely last in the standings with that netminding squad at the helm. Tough times for us Europeans committing to watching this disaster unravel early morning night after night but this is absolutely necessary for us to be competitive again- losing and drafting some great talents. I have a big respect for Huska and I adore our GM, so hopefully we are well set management wise.

I look forward for being wrong (talking to you Wolf) and can't wait to see some individuals shining and surprising."
"Volica","Aug 25, 2024","What’s your poison?"
"Mobiandi","Aug 26, 2024","My bold opinion is that Huberdeau and Kadri will combine for less than 82 points this year"
"Errol Swaghammer","Aug 26, 2024","Barring a Kadri trade I would take a heavy bet that this does not happen."
"Yepthatsme","Aug 26, 2024","Playing a full season with Kuzmenko (or atleast until he’s traded), there’s a better shot Kadri alone gets 82 points than them combined don’t.

Kadri had a 2.04 p/60 playing on the Zary-Pospisil line, once he was paired with Kuzmenko that went up to 3.11 p/60.

People underestimate how much our offense approved season to season. We will get scored on more by a drastic amount most likely, but we are going to score a fair amount more this year swapping out last season’s Lindholm and Mangiapane with last years Kuz and Mantha, not to mention a year older Zary, Coronato, and Pelletier."
"Double Dion","Aug 26, 2024","That would be pretty shocking. I could see a scenario where Huberdeau is around 40ish points. I can't see one barring injury where Kadri is.


Yes, scoring actually might go up from a year ago. We lost our full shutdown pair from last season though. We also lost our 2nd best defensive wing and our 3rd pairing best D"
"Mobiandi","Aug 26, 2024","I see Kadri at 50 and Huberdeau around 30.

Goals will be very hard to come by for this team"
"Ledge And Dairy","Aug 26, 2024","30 points? Do you expect him to get injured?

I don't think scoring will be nearly as hard as you are expecting, It's keeping it out of our own net that will be difficult. I expect will be loosing a lot of games 4-2 or 5-3, nothing like the Sharks with b2b 9-1 losses"
"","Aug 26, 2024","Yeah, all the main play drivers are still around and should be on an upwards trajectory. Unless the argument is that Hanifin drove play that much, I'm not sure why the team would have a harder time scoring than last year. 

The PP also would be hard pressed to be worse."
"super6646","Aug 26, 2024","The Flames were a league-average scoring team last year. From the looks of it, we should be running it back with a comparable fwd group.

I think we'll be around that point this year. The defence on the other hand is atrocious. I'm hoping for a ton of 4-3 or 5-4 losses while sustaining a 900+sv% from Wolf. That is the best case scenario"
"HighLifeMan","Aug 26, 2024","It's actually quite easy to see Huberdeau ""bouncing"" back to some degree. His on ice shooting percentage in all situations last year was just 9.22% which is absurdly low for a player with his usage, skill level, and historical averages. Fore example, a guy like Brock Boeser who everyone loves again, had an on ice shooting percentage of 14.93% last year. If Huberdeau had that kind of ""luck"" or finish from his teammates he would have been on the ice for 50 more goals scored.

It's not even as if Huberdeau hasn't been on the ice for a ton of scoring chances either.. He was on the ice for the third most scoring chances (866) of his career last season."
"The Gnome","Aug 26, 2024","I'll take a bourbon on the rocks any day. Should keep the season interesting at least!"
"Backlund","Aug 26, 2024","Not when you see the shots he takes or how often he actually tries to shoot."
"super6646","Aug 26, 2024","I don’t think this is true. His shot volume has plummeted since he’s come to Calgary. If anything, he needs to get more rubber to the net."
"Double Dion","Aug 26, 2024","Hanifin is a huge piece in terms of possession, but I still think this team will score fine somewhere around 20-24th in the league. We will likely be bottom 10 defensively though. That used to be our strength, but won't be now."
"hockeyguy0022","Aug 26, 2024","Flames will be better then people think.

I think Vladar will get 60-65% of games. They want to pump his stock to a number 1 guy again before the trade deadline, get a good return and cooley will back up wolf after. I'm pretty confident that's the plan.

Love the russian/canadian team composition. Love the size on the back end.

I hope kuzmenko stays, JH NEEDS a pure goal scorer to put up big points again. Florida played a totally different system then the flames. Same thing would happen if Mitch Marner played anywhere aside from Toronto/Edmonton, he would also be a 60-70 point getter, not a 100 point guy on a regular team.

I think Coronato is an everyday guy, same with Zary. I think pelletier gets a shot, but this is about the end of the road for him, trade time if he's not performing. Been passed by and they had a good draft this.. so times ticking for him."
"Ledge And Dairy","Aug 26, 2024","Last year we were 19th in GF/GP with 3.09, assuming our powerplay improves but our 5v5 play drops that will probably only drop to around 3.00. For GA/GP we were 23rd, no Markstrom and a butchered d-core will almost certainly make that number drop. But San Jose was still at 3.98 last year and Columbus was at 3.63. So based on that we probably only drop to the 3.4-3.55 range (that's about 10-25 total more GA than last year)"

"Double Dion","Aug 26, 2024","I hope we don't keep Kuzmenko. That would be a disastrous and extremely detrimental decision. Kuzmenko can score, no question about that. His contribution to winning is extremely low. Especially for a guy who would be entering his 30 year old season. Move him for the 2nd and be happy with the Lindholm trade. Huberdeau is a sunk cost. Don't sink more cost into him and further debilitate the rebuild.

Comparing Marner to Huberdeau is a bit silly. Marner drives play, is light years better in his own end and makes way less bad plays that result in possession going the other way."
"super6646","Aug 26, 2024","Ya they aren’t remotely comparable. Marner is also a pretty good skater too while JH is mediocre at best. The former is also a asset defensively and on the PK. Huberdeau on the other hand…"

My collection of both bourbon and scotch is growing nicely. Lots of cool bottles and rarer stuff in the mix now."
"Fig","Aug 27, 2024","From the USA?"
"Yepthatsme","Aug 27, 2024","Honestly think a lot would have to go wrong for Calgary to score less this year. We lost 39 goals off the roster last year combined through Lindholm, Mangiapane, Tanev, Hanifin, Kylington, and Zadorov. Incoming is Kuzmenko, who scored 39 his rookie year and was on pace for 40 with us. Going into his contract year with this being his year to receive his career contract, I expect him to be his best yet. Mantha in Washington on a low scoring team with zero expectations was on pace for 29 goals, yet we should still be able to offer him more ice time and powerplay time than Washington did. Miromanov replaces Hanifin’s 11 I think easy, if he gets a top 4 offensive time his shot alone will get him there. Then we have the goals lost from the rest of the d-core, and I think any of our replacement level guys added should be able to score… 5 goals. A big boost will come from internal growth too, with Zary, Pospisil, Pelletier and Coronato all a year older. 

The main driver behind the massive boost will be the powerplay, which after Kuzmenko got situated, operated at 24% from February 1st on. That is a massive performance boost from the 13.9% it was from October through to January 31st, and if continued would be a a main driver for the increased offense. Even with Coleman coming back down, that’s a lot of extra goals."
"DomBarr","Aug 27, 2024","your main driver of maintained or increased scoring seems to be 2 pending UFA's (Kuzmenko and Mantha) who should be sold off as soon as the Flames receive an offer that meets their expectations, especially IF they are showing performance like you project."
"","Aug 27, 2024","Any line with Pospisil and Lomberg on it is well on its way to becoming my favourite line in the history of everything. 

Especially knowing how next season is bound to go."
"Double Dion","Aug 27, 2024","I'm really high on Pospisil as a center. I just really want to see what he looks like there. He's so strong defensively and has enough pace to be deep and still get into the play offensively. I'd like to see if he could be our 3C of the future. I'd also like to see if Zary can be a 2C."
"Yepthatsme","Aug 27, 2024","Mantha scored at a 29 goal pace and went for a second last year, and any team wanting Kuzmenko is going to want to see that his production is back after disappointing last season. I fully expect to see both of them on the roster until March when there can be a bidding war, and I half expect Kuzmenko to not get traded at all if he produces what I think he can. That is plenty of time to boost the rosters offense.

Neither should or would be sold early, because neither will garner a 1st well before the deadline."
"Ledge And Dairy","Aug 27, 2024","Yeah I completely disagree with this take. As I said before our powerplay will probably be overall better than last season. That is largely due to Kumenko. But what you are not accounting for is the drop in 5v5 production. With our stripped d-core we are going to have a much harder time just getting it out of our own zone. All you did was count goals scored by individual players but you are not accounting for how those goals were created at all. Hanifin and Tanev did wonders for breaking the puck out and turning the play up ice. There's no world where Miromanov and Bahl and reproduce the transition game those 2 brought.

Also expecting anyone to score at a rate above 15% is just completely unrealistic so if you are expecting 40 goals from Kuzmenko he's probably going to need at least 250 shots on net. Also considering he will probably be traded at or before the deadline he will probably only get around 25 goals with us max"
"","Aug 27, 2024","I'll post this just in case anyone here owns a Dube jersey.."
"Yepthatsme","Aug 27, 2024","We will undoubtedly get pinned in our zone a lot more, that is without a doubt true, but the only defenseman we lost with an active hand in creating offense was Hanifin. We were never a team with a high flying breakout or a reliance in creating offense off the rush, our breakout for all intents and purposes is relatively simplistic, so losing great first pass options will hurt far less than your making it out to be. Most of where our offense from the back end comes in was activating to join the rush and create odd man opportunities, or leaving the blue line for offensive support in the zone. Only Hanifin took an active part in that for the most part of our lost defenseman, and his contributions will be missed for spreading out opposing defenses.

Tanev had 14 assists on the year and Kylington 5, both are practically replacement level totals for their ice time. Tanev was a big part of preventing chances and putting an end to sustained zone time, but as far as zone clearances, neither he nor Kylington had any ++ qualities for creating offense the opposite direction. Not to mention Andersson getting to be “the guy” on his pair with him and Weegar likely separated will also be a big boost to him, as he will now get to lean into the offensive role on his pair again.

I’d also say you’re sleeping on Miromanov, coming off a terrible ACL injury he put up respectable points all the while having a low on ice shooting percentage. Given a full camp and a forced increased role, I think he will add a pretty unique aspect to our back end offensively.

As per our forwards, Kuzmenko doesn’t need to hit 40. I’d say he has a legitimate chance at leading our forwards in goal scoring, and is a relatively safe bet for 30, so that easily replaces Lindholm’s poor 15 goal pace from last year. Maybe Mantha doesn’t get 29, but he’s paced for atleast 20 goals every single season in his 9 year career except for 1, so another easy bet to replace Mangiapane’s 14. Then having Coronato, Pelletier, Zary, Pospisil all being a year older, and an improved offense seems likely. I’m not suggesting we are about to start Harlem globe trotting teams, but between adding better goal scorers (and better creaters in the case of Kuzmenko),youth development in our forwards, and a seemingly primed boost to our powerplay totals, going from a slightly below average offense to a slightly above average offense seems likely injury pending."
"Yepthatsme","Aug 27, 2024","Instead of going back and forth about why our offense will be worse or better, why don’t we just post goal and point totals for the projected lineup? I’ll start:
Huberdeau (15G, 65p)
Zary (18G, 50p)
Sharangovich (32G, 60p)

Mantha (25G, 50p)
Kadri (28G, 75p)
Kuzmenko (35G, 80p)

Coronato (15G, 40p)
Backlund (15G, 45p)
Coleman (22G, 45p)

Pelletier (7G, 25p)
Pospisil (10G, 30p)
Lomberg (7g, 20p)

Weegar (15g, 50p)
Miromanov (13G, 45p)
Andersson (9G, 40p)
Bahl (5G, 25p)
Bean (5G, 25p)
The rest: 4G

So a completely healthy 280, dropping down to 265-270 after injuries. Coming off the belief that Mantha and Kuzmenko will be playing like crazy for their “last big contract of their careers” year, but other than that and a pretty high belief in Miro and a slight bounce back from Huberdeau, relatively realistic projections. I’m low on Coleman and Weegar falling back down to Earth (although still above average), Kadri’s goal totals slightly falling despite some extra help, and Zary’s total staying flat with the increase in responsibility."
"Backlund","Aug 27, 2024","80 points for Kuzmenko is extremely optimistic"
"Ledge And Dairy","Aug 27, 2024","No we weren't a high flying rush team but we were a team, like Carolina, that heavily relied on possession. And that possession was always run through the defense. Create turnovers at the blue line, regroup and go up ice. Hanifin lead our team almost every year in shot attempts. I'm not denying that he did shoot a lot but you are vastly undervaluing what Tanev did to set up offense too. Tanev is nothing like a Ben Chiarot or Eric Gudbranson. Those guys are fine defensively but they have zero ability to break out of the zone and very often just ice the puck or turn possession back over. Tanev was very good at preventing opposing offense but then also tuning that into sustained possession.

I don't think I'm sleeping on Miromanov at all. He will be fine but if you think he compares anywhere close to what Tanev or Hanfin provided in terms of creating possession to control the offense you are dead wrong. I think 20-25 points from him is well within reason, especially if he is paired with Weegar.

If Kuzmenko scores 30 with us before he is traded at least half of them will probably be from the man advantage. Again I have no doubt our powerplay will improve this year. But I think you are vastly overvaluing our 5v5 play. 2 years ago (22/23) all but 2 of our 29 different players on our roster had the majority of their EV strength zone starts in the offensive zone, those 2 players (Philips and Zohorna) played a combined 10 games for us. We were ridiculously dominant at 5v5 in terms of possession. Last year we had a lot more turnover on our roster (due to trades) so we had 35 different players over the course of the season. 15 of them were below 50% offensive zone starts. We took a big drop in offensive possession that season with all our trades and will likely be taking another big drop again this year.

I also don't think it's at all fair to compare Kuzmenko to Lindholm here. Kuzmenko was scoring on 24% of the shots he took and Lindholm was scoring on less than 7% of his shots. There is no way Kuzmenko will be able to sustain a number like that over a full season.

Like we can do the math here using ixG from last season with the likely starting 18 (19 because I decided to add Coronato even though I think Pelletier will make the team instead due to waiver exemption)
Kadri = 
Coleman - 28.92/78 = 
Backlund = 
Sharangovich = 
Huberdeau - 19.54/81 = 
Pospisil - 13.57/63 = 
Zary - 11.93/63 = 
Andersson - 9.98/78 = 
Weegar = 
Kuzmenko - 7.79/29 = 
Miromanov - 2.24/20 = 
Rooney - 3.28/33 = 
Pelletier - 0.78/13 = 
Coronato - 6.19/34 = 
Pachal - 1.53/33 = 
Mantha - 14.94/74 = 
Lomberg - 7.02/75 = 
Bahl = 
Bean 3.54/72 = 

Total ixG from these 19 players = 
That's if all 19 players were to play all 82 games (which is not possible). It's just simply not likely that all of them score this many goals. Not everyone is going to play all 82 games. Then if we cut Mantha and Kuzmenko to only 60 games played due to trades that number drops even more. I said in my original post that we would probably score closer to a 3.00 GF/GP instead of 3.09 from this most recent season. That's about  total goals, instead of the 253 we scored last year."
"Ledge And Dairy","Aug 27, 2024","An expectation of 280 goals for is just not at all realistic. That would have ranked us 6th last year and clearly in contender status of scoring. You will have to chop at least 30-40 goals off here somewhere to make it at all realistic. Also 80 points for Kuzmenko and 45 for Miromanov is nuts."
"Yepthatsme","Aug 28, 2024","I think my favorite part of all this so far has been you adding up the iXG to exactly what my first prediction was, then saying why you think it’s completely unreasonable. The cumulative total of our iXG is already 280, without the added effect of a more offensive environment, a better powerplay, and progression of our young players included. Your numbers already seem to dictate we will likely score more goals, yet you used that as a detractor?

You didn’t read my post well, I already included man games lost bringing us down to about 265-270 which seems realistic for this roster. Trades will also give increased roles to other players so it’s not like those goals are completely lost. You also used 6th place to represent some sort of rarified air obtained through a massive jump that is unattainable to us (you’re right we won’t to around top 5 though), but the difference between 10th and 19th (us) in the NHL was a whopping 13 goals. Not a Herculean leap to once again just say we might have an above average offense this year.

Also Kuzmenko potted 74 points in his rookie season, and gave us a 71 point pace despite 4 points in his first 9 games or 8 in his first 18. You think it’s crazy he beats those totals by 6 points and 9 points respectively, after realistically given the keys to our offense this year. Miro I’m operating on a hunch, he’s put up insanely good offensive stats in the AHL, and I think we just saw him scrape the surface coming back from injury. He already had a 29 point pace after missing a year and a half of hockey, so once again your hyperbole calling a jump in points after what he’s went through nuts is something."
"Ledge And Dairy","Aug 28, 2024","Yes because that assumed 19/18 players played a full 82 games. Again that is literally impossible since only 18 players can play in any game. On top of that is completely unrealistic to expect 18 players to play all 82 games. Reality is it will be more like 5 players play all 82 and some will play as low as 45. 

Powerplay ice time is about 20% of 5v5 ice time. You are really not factoring in how much worse our 5v5 play will be. Last year we had 167 5v5 GF and 44 PP GF. Even if that PP production increases to somewhere between 50 and 55 we will probably have less than 150 5v5 GF. 

Kuzmenko won't be in Calgary for a full 82 games, he will be moved before the deadline. So even if he paces 80 points (which is probably a bit high) he will probably only get like 50-60 max with us."
"DomBarr","Aug 28, 2024","I am not going to look at stat pages to not agree with your goal scoring estimates as a lot of your estimates seem reasonable however..
Sharangovich is more likely to score 20 than 30 so make it 25 so - 7 g
Mantha regresses to norm is traded in January for picks and only scores 10 for Calgary so -15g
Kuzmenko is traded in Feb and only scores 25 so -10g
Coleman regresses back to career norm lets say 17 g so -5 g

the skill traded out and goals lost because of it are not replaced.
So that takes it from 280 to 243 and realistically I can't see this team breaking 240 because of the overall reduction in skill"
"Nanuuk","Aug 28, 2024","I think we our ceiling is challenging for the play-offs for all the reasons that you have mentioned.

I will also add we will not have to suffer through a few losses when the likes of Oesterle were playing. I have a lot more confidence in our defence IF Andersson returns to form.

Our floor is at or below our season of last year. Which is what way too many fans are cheering for."
"","Aug 28, 2024","Sounds like we need an optimism thread."
"Fig","Aug 28, 2024","Start one."
"Yepthatsme","Aug 28, 2024","You also posted stats from how players played last year, and it already says expect more goals. Yet it doesn’t include the effect of adding two legitimate offensive threats for a season adds to a roster. For example, Kuzmenko really turned the corner in March, playing his best hockey by far to finish the year. From March to the end of the season Kadri’s p/60 was 3.31 from his usual 2.84 prior. Sharangovich getting the additional help as well jumped from 2.94 p/60 from 2.31. Even with a majority of the vets mailing it in post trade deadline, Kuzmenko provided a large boost to the players he played with. Same as Mantha, who adds a seriously legitimate shooting threat to whichever line he plays on. Things that aren’t even reflected in the stats you posted, yet it still expects high totals. It also doesn’t include the powerplay, which seems primed for a boost this year with added options and based on how it finished the year prior.

You used the game played argument, but forget to realize the kind of player who play 45 games which are replacement level guys. I.E players who can be replaced and not notice any difference. So you say “but they’ll only play 45 games”, but someone of relatively equal value will play those other 37. Our top of the roster players missed roughly 15-20 games total last year, so yes there will be goals lost but pending some brutal injuries which we haven’t seen since Monahan, the total goals lost won’t be anywhere near 20 let alone 40.

Also I heavily encourage you to post a poll on the main boards on who would add more offense to a team, Chris Tanev or Andrei Kuzmenko. Yes we will get pinned more, and Tanev was a huge loss in starting the play the other way, but you have to understand that an improved forward core has much more of an impact on creating offense than… a defensive defenseman. Like you have to see the logic that Cale Makar getting the puck to Ryan Reaves will be a lot less conducive to gaining offense than Erik Gudbranson rimming the puck along the boards to McDavid, right? Breaking up plays and making a good first pass is important, but unless we are depending on blowing the zone and expecting seem passes or stretch passes on the daily, losing non-offensive defenseman and gaining offensive forwards will increase 5v5 scoring, that’s a pretty simple concept. Given the simplistic nature of our breakout (seriously, when we force a turnover in our zone how often did we do anything other than just head man the puck to a forward), we aren’t losing much to begin with anyways other than our ability to break up zone pressure. As a defenseman myself, I can tell you how much easier a breakout is when you have better forwards on the ice to begin with. To end all this, we also still have Andersson and Weegar who will be likely anchoring two separate pairs, so it’s not like we are bereft of two way defenseman to begin the season either

We added a player who scores 20 in his sleep (almost literally if some people are to be believed), and another guy who’s paced for 40 goals 3/4 of the time he’s been in the league so far. Our powerplay will be better, and we have 3-4 young forwards who will now have another season under their belt for experience. Losing two defenseman who combined for 49 points will not ruin the 5v5 offense as much as a full season of a guy paced for 71 and another who paced for 50 on a much worse offense than ours. Guys like Kuzmenko, Kadri, Sharangovich, and Coleman could all regress to the extreme and I could very easily be wrong, but pretending it’s impossible for us to score more goals is equally as wrong."
"DomBarr","Aug 28, 2024","The worst thing the can occur with the Flames with their current ownership at this point in time is challenging for or even worse being solidly in a playoff spot at the deadline where ownership will pressure Conroy to fortify the lineup for playoff revenue. 
and if you think we are not going to experience losses like there were last year you are over estimating the skill on the Flames D. The new dmen brought in are not better than Tanev, Hanifin, Kylington so while Oesterle is gone outside of Weegar/Andersson the other 4 will provide some entertaining brain farts.
Fans do not want to cheer for the teams to lose but most realize that there is always some pain before things turn around. This team's #1 need right now is high end, game breaking center that only seem to be available in the top 5 picks of a draft and over the next 2 drafts there are some true franchise altering centers at the top of the draft like Hagens, McKenna etc"
"Double Dion","Aug 28, 2024","Really? You think this roster with 2 top 5 defensemen can challenge for the playoffs? I think we're a front half lottery team almost for sure. Only way we get anywhere close to even 20th is if our goaltending is outstanding. We're going to BLEED chances this year. Even if Backlund and Kadri don't decline which could happen at any point.

The only teams we MIGHT be better than in the West are Anaheim, San Jose, Chicago and Seattle. Utah is a vastly improved roster. Everyone else is very clearly better than us."

"Some Other Flame","Aug 28, 2024","Weegar-Miromanov
Bahl-Andersson
Bean-Pachal
Solovyov/Hanley

That is likely the worst defensive group the Flames have iced in their history. And there's also a non-zero percent chance that Andersson is traded by the deadline. 

Last rebuild had GIordano turn into a norris worthy defenceman overnight while Brodie emerged as a top pairing guy. There's nothing like that this time."
"Ledge And Dairy","Aug 28, 2024","Let me try and explain this a different way. If I remove Kuzmenko, Mantha, Lomberg, etc from the equation and replace them with Lindholm, Mangiapane, Dube, etc. The ixG is actually much higher. 
Kuzmenko/Mantha/Lomberg total for 46.27
while Lindholm/Mangiapane/Dube (24.32+25.51+9.13) total for 58.96. Nearly 13 extra expected goals. That's not even factoring in the 4 defensemen we swapped out who should raise it more. 

Again I agree our powerplay will be better but I don't think you get how much worse our 5v5 play will be. Sure Kuzmenko is useful in the offensive zone specifically around the net but if we can't get anywhere near there he is borderline useless. We have been a possession style team for like the last 5 years. That style of play is not going to change this season but it will be vastly less dominant without the quality of blue line we had in past seasons. Yes in theory offensive forwards should increase scoring but unfortunately you can't win a 3v5 or 4v5 without superstar talents like McDavid. 

I never said it was impossible to score more goals I just say expecting a 15-20 goal increase is not at all realistic. A 7 goal fall off is far more realistic. I think we will be on par with the Senators from last season who has 250 GF and 281 GA"
"HighLifeMan","Aug 28, 2024","I think the defense actually has far more potential than it's given credit for, although I can understand the pessimism.

Weegar/Miro were absolutely dominant together despite playing some very tough minutes down the stretch. Yes, it wasn't a huge sample size, but they showed some seriously positive signs together.

Bahl and Andersson in theory make a great compliment to one another from a stylistic POV. Bahl has already shown capable of playing tough minutes last year while consistently improving his defensive partners xG%, and if Andersson returns to form (lets be real he struggled last year), then it could be a strong pair.

Third pair? Who really knows, Bean has had NHL success previously in a larger role, and Pachal appears to be a serviceable #6/7."

Miromanov is an interesting case. You can very much make the argument that were he not on such a stacked contender (Vegas) his NHL experience to this point would be much higher. The question remains if he is an NHL player in the long run, but to say one way or the other now is too early.

Bean + Pachal, I will grant you are 6/7 guys and not much else and on most teams are spares."
"Ledge And Dairy","Tuesday at 5:25 PM","I think you are using a broad brush for a bit of fine painting here. While yes Backlund is a proven strong 2-way player and his CF and TA/GA ratio do defend that I do not think TA/GA is a good measure for that. Players with high giveaway counts are very often the person who simply has the puck the most. Weegar for example only had 46 takeaways but 75 giveaways. This does not reflect how strong his defensive game is at all considering he is one of the best 2-way defenders in the league. To me the important note there is that he lead all our defensemen in takeaways (albeit Hanifin probably would have had more if he wasn't traded), this proves he is effective at causing turnovers. On the other hand his giveaway count says to me how much we relied on him as a playmaker and QB. His production from last season also in a way proves that. 

As for Kuzmenko, as you said he was very sheltered with his deployment, as was Kadri. This is also quite obvious when looking at their QoC on . Kadri and Kuzmenko only spent about ~27% of their total 5v5 ice time against elite competition, whereas on the other hand guys like Backlund, Mangiapane, and Lindholm all played north of 40% of their ice time vs elite competition. I just have a hard time seeing us being able to deploy those 2 in such favorable positions again this year. Assuming we move Zary to center it will probably be in our best interest to shelter his line more than Kadri's or at least split the difference. As for Kuzmenko's takeaway count, it reminds me a lot of Nylander. In the offensive and Neutral zone Kuzmenko can for turnovers by simply being aggressive, but he was simply not that effective in our own end, hence his -8 in a 29 game span. 

I do think  is a bit wrong about Mantha though. He is very much like Mangiapane in his defensive game but his main issue is he lacks commitment and drive. Unlike Mangiapane who had an endless motor, Mantha is well known for his lackadaisical effort levels."

Either be a below average team in one ranking and a bottom 10 in the other (where we fell), or be an above average team in one and bottom 5 in the other. This is where I think we reasonably fall, and expect us to probably pick from 6-10 in the upcoming draft.

After that, I say it’s about as likely as picking in the 4-5 range that we are outside the bottom 10 teams. This would likely be due to our offense finishing around 12-14th in the league and our defense only being bad (bottom 10).

So based on last season’s standings, our floor looks to start roughly at about the 5th overall pick."

"Some Other Flame","Thursday at 1:05 PM","Most if not all of the teams that finished below the Flames made varying degrees of improvements to their roster during the off season. 

The Flames meanwhile traded their number one goalie, signed an inconsistent middle six forward and some meaningless depth. And now the word is apparently that it's only a matter of when, not if Andersson is moved. 

Short of something ridiculous happening, the Flames are primed for their first top 3 pick in franchise history."
"KodakGinger","Thursday at 2:44 PM","Don’t think there’s any doubt with this roster that we select top 6 and get a shot at one of the top 5 centres in the draft. Good year to have a C heavy top 5."
"Yepthatsme","Friday at 7:01 PM","Chicago, San Jose, and Colombus are absolutely guaranteed to be worse than us. Full stop. Those 3 combined have 8 players who scored 20 last year, with 3 of those names doing it on top offensive teams and not with them. We have 6.

San Jose’ goalies are Blackwood and Askarov. Chicago is Mrazek and Brossoit. Columbus is Merzlikins and Tarasov. This is one of the few groups our goaltending tandem doesn’t stand out from. Columbus may be the only group who doesn’t have just as large of a group as no names as our defensive core, and Weegar is the best defenseman out of any of those teams.

Serious question, if we added Bertuzzi and Teuravainen, or Toffoli and Ceci, would you consider us a very improved team primed to climb the standings? The top 3 is very well protected, as I just pointed out with how bad of a team you have to be to enter that group in my previous post."
"hockeyguy0022","Friday at 8:44 PM","Flames should flip a prospect or two and some picks for zegras.

Minimal contract left, can see if he develops, have the money for long term If wanted, if not can flip for a pick. basically 0 risk, all upside.

poor mans Mitch Marner, with upside. No risk for the flames basically."
"Ledge And Dairy","Friday at 8:56 PM","San Jose? 100% they will be worse. They will definitely score more than last year between Celebrini, Smith, and Toffoli, but overall their D-core is still quite bad.

Columbus will be like Anaheim, their success now depends entirely on the young guys taking that next step. I would also say that it depends on how well they rally behind the loss of Johnny Hockey, but I would expect them to finish below us. 

Chicago I wouldn't be shocked to see them finish below us but I would say they are more likely to finish above us. Their D-core is far deeper than ours, they essentially added 3 top 6 wingers with the return of Hall, along with a solid middle 6 2-way guy in Mikheyev. It's well within the realm of possibility that Bedard hits 100 points this season. Not to mention Brossoit is a big upgrade on Soderblom."
"Yepthatsme","Friday at 11:00 PM","Success depending on young guys leads to a lack of success, this is a fact HFboards can’t comprehend. Ask Ottawa and Buffalo how relying solely on youth in key roles has faired for their teams. Columbus (and Anaheim while we are at it) thrusting even more U24 players into key roles will be a detriment not a boon.

Also if Bertuzzi and this stage of his career Hall are top 6 wingers, we have roughly 6 of them on our roster. Bertuzzi potted 21 lining up with Tavares and Nylander, and Hall wasn’t even on pace for 50 points 2 years ago and is well passed his prime after injuries unfortunately. I think your right Bedard has a chance at 100 and will probably drag one of Bertuzzi or Teravainen to 60 points along the way, but the other will have to anchor a second line on their own which is terrifying. Teravainen is legitimately their second best forward, that’s still an embarrassing group.

That deeper blue line part is not true, it’s just weirdly old.
Chicago:
Vlasic •2.5 xGA/60
Jones •2.7 xGA/60
Brodie* •2.77 xGA/60
Martinez* •2.81xGA/60
Murphy •2.9 xGA/60
Korchinski •3.13 xGA/60

Pachal •2.21 xGA/60
Miromanov •2.23 xGA/60
Bahl •2.39 xGA/60
Weegar •2.64 xGA/60
Bean •2.83 xGA/60
Andersson 2.88 xGA/60

You just fell victim to a pretty classic “I recognize more names on the other blue line”, as far as results go our blue line depth is far superior. For example, TJ Brodie was a healthy scratch for Toronto’s whole playoffs if you’re wondering how he’s doing currently."
"","Friday at 11:13 PM","and you just fell victim to a pretty classic ""analytics re the be all and end all"""
"Ledge And Dairy","Friday at 11:54 PM","I'm not arguing the youth thing for Anaheim and Columbus. What is factual about them is that they have added a bunch of young high potential players to their roster and we have not. So like I said I expect Columbus to finish below us I would not call it a guarantee by any means. A full season of Werenski for them could vastly change things for example, as he is a top 10 caliber defenseman in the league when healthy.

Kuzmenko and Huberdeau are only winger on our roster that even comes close to Bertuzzi's or Hall's caliber. Both of them will get prime power play minutes too, something Bertuzzi didn't get in Toronto.

Your take on their blue line is awful too. All you are doing is looking at 1 stat and comparing them. You don't even bother trying to factor in the difference in situations. Last year when Bedard wasn't on the ice Chicago had next to zero offensive pressure so they were constantly caved in in their own end.

For example despite all this Vlasic was statistically the best defensive dman in the league last year. And he was a rookie. Korchinski was also a rookie and will certainly improve this year, plus they will have Murphy back who missed the majority of last season with an injury. And though Brodie played like crap last year he was one of the top defensive dmen in the league just 1 year prior. Even if he can't reform that Levshunov is right there ready to take a spot

I didn't fall victim to that I simply know the sport better than you"

"Yepthatsme","Friday at 12:29 AM","You called Werenski a top 10 defenseman in the league when healthy in the same post you said you know the sport better than me LOL.

Also your Bertuzzi take is funny. Go on the polls and see who posters would rather have. Sharangovich or Bertuzzi. Coleman or 2024-25 Hall. You pretend Bertuzzi wasn’t stapled to a 98 point Nylander all season, and he had less points than Anthony Mantha did last year. “We only have two Bertuzzi caliber wingers” got a laugh out of me so thanks for that.

Weren’t you the poster who said getting less offensive zone time and getting caved in is a function of how bad the defense was, not offense, literally last week when you were trying to argue that Calgary losing Hanifin-Tanev would cripple our offense? Crazy how the tune changes to not having good enough forwards means they get caved in defensively when that’s what the argument calls for. Especially when the implication is Teravainen and Bertuzzi will save that D-core.

Vlasic isn’t the best defensive defenseman in the league, you just don’t understand relative stats. Because that’s where that sentiment began, with the fact he had the 5th best xGA/60 Rel in the league. The irony of you saying XGA/60 is a cherry picked stat then you accidentally try to use it in your argument is great. The absolute irony of you saying he’s the best because he looked so good in comparison to the rest of the brutal D-core you’re trying to defend is even better.

As far as actual suppression metrics, he was 88th in xGA/60, 74th in GA/60, and 148th in HDCA/60. So slightly above average except at suppressing chances. So definitely good, mostly because you have to give him credit with just how bad his team is at defense which you are unironically trying to defend.

Whenever you’re feeling cocky enough to say you know the sport better than people, I want you to go to the main boards and call Werenksi a top 10 defenseman and read the responses."
"Tkachuk Norris","Friday at 1:10 AM","The forward lines have been pretty obvious to me, although it might not play out that way. The D lines are tougher to figure out. 

Sharongovich-Kadri-Kuzmenko

Interesting skill on this line

Huberdeau-Zary-Mantha

We got Mantha to get Huberdeau going allegedly. I donno personally I’d like to see Zary C Hubs and Sharon.

Coleman-Backlund-Coronato 

Get our best forward prospect with two guys who mesh so well. 

Pelletier-Pospisil-Lomberg

Paramount that we develop Zary and Pospisil at C. This would be a fun line to watch. Pospisil and Pelletier can also kill penalties to get more minutes. 

Bahl-Weegar

Yeah pain will be felt when you look at this blue line. But I think Huska is really good at making D men useful. I think Bahl could surprise people.

Revolving door-Andersson

Basically let whoever of Miromanov, Solo, Kuznetsov, Poirier try to take a spot, give each significant NHL games. Bean, Pachal, Hanley can play some games if you need them to, I just don’t see any long term upside so what is the point in playing them more then 25-30 games each."

1. Flames have too many wingers & forwards. Bringing in Mantha when Kuzmenko was already there was superfluous 

2. At least one but ideally both Zary and Pospisil need to play center this season otherwise what's the point

3. All of Pelletier, Coronato, & Solovyov need to be on the roster. Having zero prospects/rookies make the team in year 1 of the rebuild is a horrendously myopic strategy. But it would be quintessential Calgary Flames though."
"Ledge And Dairy","Friday at 3:25 AM","LMAO spewing more words per minute does not make you smart.

1. I did not call Werenski a top 10 defenseman, I called him top 10 caliber. As in Makar, Fox, Hughes, Josi, Heiskanen, McAvoy, and Hedman are definitely better. After that there is absolutely an argument for him among others. He's definitely in the 8-15 range though.

2. Sharangovich has had 1 season over 50 points and he produced well above expectations in that season. He might hit 50 points again this year but ~45 is a safer bet for him, and definitely not 30 goals again. Bertuzzi will very likely outproduce him this season. I am a huge Coleman fan and have defending him for years but you are on drugs if you think he is better than Hall. Coleman is elite defensively but he is not remotely as good offensively as Hall.

3. You are putting words in my mouth I was very clear that Hockey is a 5 man game. 2 defenseman can not be expected to stop 5 on the other team alone. And vise-versa 3 forwards can not be expected to beat 5 people defending as a unit on the other team alone. Obviously considering you had the audacity to write me a book on the day of Gaudreau's death I was definitely going to ignore it.

Yes Vlasic was actually. He was literally in the 99 percentile for defensive play last year. Again, as a rookie"
"Yepthatsme","Friday at 2:50 PM","The rest of it is just bad, but you really need to learn stats before you quote them. Defensive GAR is comprised entirely of relative stats. Here’s the formula:

(((RelT CA/Min - RL CA/Min)*-TOI) + ((RelT xGA/Min - RL xGA/Min)*-TOI))

Please educate yourself before getting in to these discussions, your proof that he wasn’t just good because of relative stats was to entirely use relative stats. He was rated the best defensive defenseman literally because how much he stood out from how terrible the rest of his defense core was. His actual results were middling, but with context on the defense core he was definitely an above average defensive defenseman.

If you’re going to quote these stats please atleast try to understand them first."
"Ledge And Dairy","Friday at 5:22 PM","The amount of fabrication you use in your arguments is hilarious. You literally just make your own assumptions and insert them as fact. 

I said Chicago struggled to form any sort of offense without Bedard on the ice last year. That is fact. You then brought up how I previously said Calgary lost offense due to loosing Tanev and Hanifin, saying that I am being a hypocrite by arguing that offensive zone time is a ""function of defense not offense."" No it's a 5v5 game I was very clear on this. In the post last week I had also brought up how Calgary doesn't have a McDavid to just singlehandedly turn a game around. Chicago does though in Bedard, and after they lost Hall and Perry last year Bedard was the only legitimate top 6 forward on their entire roster. 

I said you only use 1 stat, expected goals for/against. Then in a separate statement I stated that Vlasic was statistically the best defensive dman in the league last year. Just because his relative xGA/60 agrees he was good you just assumed that was the stat I used. Which it was not as I showed in my next post where I gave you a graph indicating his defensive GAR. 

The after I posted his defensive GAR you make up some bullshit about how I was trying to prove ""he wasn’t just good because of relative stats."" Like where did I say that????

You are lost man. You act all pretentious but your entire argument is based on you putting words into my mouth. I'm done talking to you, because we still have a month before the season starts and you will keep finding ways to argue pointlessly. I'll let the season prove you wrong instead, and if by some miracle you end up right and like Miromanov gets 45 points or something then I will tip my hat and admit it but I highly doubt he gets even 30 points."

I am an optimist.

I don't think our defensive corps will be as bad as some seem to think. This will be year 2 of a zone defence system. Meaning man to man coverage isn't a thing and also meaning the level of talent needed to play man to man isn't there. Guys like Miromanov and Pachal will see lots of ice and we will see if they are up to the challenge.

I think our goaltending may be challenged. If only from the lack of experience. But once the lads are into it those concerns will lessen. Both Vladar and Wolf have talent.

I'm pretty satisfied with the forward group. Sure a 1C that puts up 100 points would be ideal, but again we have a lot of talent up there. Some concerns are whether the second year men (Zary, Pospisil) will be re-roled as centres and what effect will that have on their overall play?

Certainly we have offensive potential from Huberdeau, Sharangovich, Kuzmenko, Mantha, Coleman, Coronato, Pelletier on the wings. Lots of talent there.

Kadri, Backlund, and Rooney will be solid centres. Offensive production from Kadri has to be counted on. If he slides a bit hopefully one of Posp or Zary can take up the slack.

Our powerplay will be a strong point of the team this year. And it will win us a lot of games, unlike the last two years. New PP coach, some more talent will do the trick.

I'm not overly worried about the PK either. It could be a challenge, but the main guys at forward are still there and it has always been well coached. So if new players get PK duty I'm sure they'll step right in.

Will we make the play-offs? I can hear the harrumphs and chortles now. It is a goal that all teams must have. I think that if the moon and stars align, then yes we can. Best case scenario.

More likely we will compete once again and then fall out of the picture. A couple more vets, or at least one, will head out at the trade dead line.

The Flames will do their job keeping us occupied during long cold winters and release us for outdoor activities in the spring.
