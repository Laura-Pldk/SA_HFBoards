He costs more, ATM. He would bring a better return. It would make Scheifele better. His net effect on goals would be easier to replace.

"","Aug 2, 2024","Things have gone pretty dead here. Bombers thread has more activity than all the Jets threads combined. 

There were a few things that were expected to have happened by now, that should have happened by now, that have not.

McGroarty (and/or his camp) seem to have poisoned the well, preventing a trade from happening. The only things Chevy could do about that are to sell for pennies on the dollar or to wait. No surprise, he is waiting. It could be a long wait. Really nothing left for us to discuss there until something happens.

No such thing affecting Ehlers. Is he still quietly being shopped? Is he going to be extended? Is he going to be used as an own rental? Good questions but, again, not much more to be discussed there until something happens, or a good new rumour pops up.

There have been a few roster moves. What has gone is better than what has been added, IMO. The Jets were overachievers last regular season, again IMO. The rest of the Central has gotten better, at least on paper. Add up those factors and Jets could fall a long way next season. A single key injury could have them out of the PO. With just avg luck all around, I see them 4th in the Div next year.

Jets still have holes at RD, top 6C and possibly 3rd pair D. They lack really high end players. They have some good prospects that could come in and be effective filling those holes, either this season or next. Maybe. But they will still lack really high end or elite players.

I think Jets need a trade or two to address some of their issues. Not likely to get any elite level players in trade unless they get a near ready prospect who eventually develops to that level. Even prospects with that potential are hard to acquire by trade but just maybe possible.

McGroarty and Ehlers are presumably still available but haven't produced a move yet. I'm wondering if we could add trade chips and make something happen? I don't mean lesser pieces like Stanley or Iafallo or Pionk who have been mentioned. They would already be available as adds for the right return. Lets say we add Perfetti and Connor as possible trade chips. Would that give us enough to spring something loose?

Obviously any trade scenario would need to consider replacing whoever we part with. But we have some near ready replacements in the system. Integrating more than 1 or 2 of them would equal a youth movement and maybe a step back for a year. But what is the problem with that if the alternative, running it back, also means a step back? And then there would be the return package.

I'm not proposing anything specific here. I'm looking at the subject of this thread and not being thrilled by the prospect of subtracting a couple of key players and otherwise going into the season with the same group that was so clearly not good enough in the PO. I'm soliciting ideas."

"voyageur","Aug 2, 2024","It really seems like the Jets aren't going to make any more moves...Signing Perfetti is the last piece of the puzzle...

If you go by one way contracts the Jets are likely not giving a spot to Lambert out of camp. Namestnikov would be the likely 2C to start, though it is possible that Perfetti gets that gig. With a new coach, who seems to have more confidence in him. That could alter lines a little. Gus and Kupari seem to be the guys battling for 4th line vs. PB. 

8 defensemen seems probable, with one of Fleury or Coughlan winning the final spot...Maybe both get send down if a forward wins a spot in TC.

I'm going to say that Perfetti bridges at about $3.25 million AAV, and if my math is any good you subtract Comrie, AJF, JAD off the Puck Pedia roster, add Heinola, Fleury/Coughlan, Perfetti, and the remaining cap space is about $3.25 million...that seems to be the comfort zone Chevy likes to operate in other than the one year the Jets spent to the Cap, had to waive Nash since they wouldn't waive Beaulieu, to call up Berdin with Hellebuyck out short term, and missed the playoffs with little room to manoeuver..last couple of years Jets haven't LTIR'd anyone when injured, just used the extra Cap space to bring up multiple players, and still have Cap space for deadline deals."
"Whileee","Aug 2, 2024","If the Jets pay Perfetti about 3.3M on a bridge and run a 22 player roster (13F 7D 2G) they will have about 4M in cap space to begin the season."

"","Aug 3, 2024","WARNING: TLDR Thunder storm at the lake this morning post.


New seasons are a bit of a crap shoot.

I was listening to NHL network on XM season ending GM report Cards yesterday and Boomer Gordon gave Chevy and A grade. It was nice to hear an outsiders perspective. He recapped pretty well that after the Vegas loss, Bones melt down, PLD wanting out, Wheeler needing to be bought out, and the rumors of Scheifele and Helly wanting out he thought the Jets were going to have to tear it down.

He felt getting Helle and Schief done, PLD moved for a good package, then the type of season the team had where they gave up the fewest goals in the NHL while having no trouble scoring was pretty much as good as it gets for a GM’s effort given how dire things had looked.

Honestly before that report I had been reflecting a bit more on how good last season was and how much fun it was to watch our team most nights. Of course there were ups and downs but 52-24-6 for 110 points was outstanding.

The playoffs really REALLY soured me but I am starting to at least be able to appreciate what that team got done in the regular season.

It leads me to believe that Mark and TNSE will head into this season with some confidence that they have a good hockey team. I don’t expect any panic.

Now to 2024-2025 projections that is interesting. I will wait to see what our final roster looks like. August is always quite.

Things I am currently pondering (I will probably make full predictions before the season):

Can Arniel keep the team playing that (“Jets hockey”) defensive, pressure, system the Jets played last season?

How will the goaltending do this season?

What is the over under for Gabe on games played? I am expecting 50ish.

Will any prospect emerge (Ville or Lambert)

How will Hail Mary Alphie do on the Moose/Jets.

How will Cole’s season go under a new coach.

How will the new coaching staff perform.

Obviously it will be interesting to follow the loose ends (Ehlers status, Mr Magoo)


I think this is still a good hockey team but we captured lightning in a bottle last season and that team overachieved in the regular season IMO."
"","Aug 3, 2024","What action will pick up as we get close to camps opening? Action here? Sure, we will have things to talk about, starting with the Young Stars Tournament. But training camp is not a time when trades happen. Early season? Nope, not often.

I think Jets need change. As time passes it becomes less and less likely until the TD gets close. McGroarty for another 2C rental? Ehlers as an own rental and then walks? Is that what we should expect?"
"Buffdog","Aug 3, 2024","All are good questions

For me, the big one will be whether Arniel keeps the same style of play that Bones had, or will he tweak it?

It's my personal belief that the effort/exertion need to be successful in that system leads to players fatiguing as the season rolls on. I think that was one reason for our collapse two seasons ago, and contributed to our bad streak last season (that was righted towards the end) and ultimately the playoff shitshow

It's a lot easier to play that way early on in the season before nagging injuries creep in and everyone gets ground down

I seem to recall a Dallas player last year commenting that playing ""Bones hockey"" wins games but isn't ""fun"" to do"
"Weezeric","Aug 3, 2024","For me a successful season includes a step back points wise while integrating young players. If Heinola, Samberg, Perfetti and one of Lambert or Chibrikov are fully entrenched and succeeding in their roles by the end of the year and the Jets get 95-100 points, huge success."
"Whileee","Aug 3, 2024","In what ways do you think the Jets' current roster is inferior to the beginning of last season?

I'd say that back-up goaltending is weaker. The 3rd D pair might be weaker, depending on how Miller and Heinola/Stanley etc. pan out. 2nd D pair might actually be better with Samberg-Pionk, based on past pair performance.

I think the forwards are as good or better (based on development of Perfetti and Barron).

I think it's up to the coaches to ensure that Scheifele's line doesn't get buried 5v5 and the special teams improve (especially the PK).

110 points is a very high bar, but the overall roster hasn't really diminished and improvements in the special teams might offset some of the deficits."
"sipowicz","Aug 3, 2024","No replacement for Dillon on D, good luck with the squirt sized D corps this season Chevy!"

"WolfHouse","Aug 3, 2024","Can we shorten that to Blogan"
"Whileee","Aug 3, 2024","Reality is that the Jets consistently give up more chances and goals against when Connor is on the ice than when he's not. It's not a short -term issue.

I think there are specific reasons why the Jets struggle defensively when Connor is on the ice.

1. Zone exits... Connor is very weak at zone exits so opposing teams exploit that by pressuring the Jets to his side when he's on the ice. A failed zone exit results in extended D zone time that leads to the D and F tiring out and giving up scoring chances.

2. Connor has a penchant for turnovers at his blue line when trying for quick rush offense. Those turnovers result in high danger rushes against.

3. Offensive zone turnovers... Connor has a very predictable approach to offensive zone strategy, with lots of small area maneuvers and twists and cut-backs deep in the offensive zone. The problem is that good teams know how to defend that with good structure, and when Connor or linemates turn the puck over they are usually starting deep in the offensive zone, while opponents are well-structured for break outs and transition offense, which sometimes leads to extended D zone time for Connor at the end of their usual shift length.

In terms of the actual shot volumes and locations against the Jets, it's pretty clear that the Jets are facing a lot more while Connor is on the ice."
"TS Quint","Aug 3, 2024","Turnovers are not an issue with Connor. Since 17/18 he sits 16th on the Jets /60. So we are supposed to replace him with Ehlers who is 5th? the only other Jet who played significant time and was worse than Ehlers for turnovers is Laine.

Even your chart shows the LW gives up more shots from the point than Connor. And the big heat is infront of the net. That's the responsibility of the centre and defense. 

Using these blanket stats that input 10 players on the ice and attributing the output to one player is dubious at best. At worst you find what you are trying to find by starting at the answer and work backwards."
"WolfHouse","Aug 3, 2024","This is a bit skewed given that connor is not on the 5v5 shutdown line - prob more about indictment of scheif and a dem9nstration of Lowry importance"
"","Aug 3, 2024","Goal, mainly backup, but I don't expect a Vezina from Hellebuyck every season.

D corps in total, without going into pairs, for the absence of Dillon. DeMelo showed some cracks in his game last year. He might be beginning to decline.

Several F will be starting a slow decline. Not saying any are washed up but each year they will be slightly less effective than the year before.

 there is a significant improvement in ST they could still do very well.  Scheifele and Connor are broken up the top 6 might be better. But we still don't have a 2C. Vilardi will still probably miss 25-35% of the season. Ehlers' status is still up in the air.

I don't know why people keep expecting more from Barron. His production will increase if his role is increased but he will be the same player."
"Weezeric","Aug 3, 2024","So basically you can count on the bad things to continue to be bad, and the good things to become less good. Quite a pessimistic view of the world."
"","Aug 3, 2024","Agree with most. I hope Kupari battles for a spot. I expect him to clear waivers and start the season with the Moose.

I don't mind Names at 2C but I hope Perfetti claims the job."
"surixon","Aug 3, 2024","The issue is he gets outscored in terms of actual goals unless he is separated from Mark. He does well with Perfetti in terms of outscoring and did well with Dubois as well. Him and Scheifele just stink together and really shouldn't be played outside of the pp or 3 on 3 as a unit. 

I'd like to see this:

KC Perfetti Vilardi speed and scoring, two/way playmaking and two/way size.

Put Fly with Mark and give them Nino for RW."
"","Aug 3, 2024","Who's Hail Mary Alphy? 

Which team is the real Jets, regular season or PO?
I think it is somewhere in between. The pair of top 6 F rentals appeared to do more harm than good in the PO but they are gone. Regular season Jets did overachieve though. So I expect a step back. How big a step is tough to guess. The competition in the Central appears to have gotten better."
"","Aug 3, 2024","If they managed to integrate that much youth and have them succeeding in their roles I would expect a step back. That would not be a bad thing as I think it would be limited to 1 or 2 years. The next year add Salomonsson, the other of Lambert or Chib and Barlow and we are looking at a rebuilt team. And we would have also added to our prospect pool.

Not sure who all are out with all that youth coming in."
"","Aug 3, 2024","I agree - this was a least part of it - 
I'd add that they didn't get much done in the Nzone like they did all season - that's where you need to disrupt the Aves because they will dominate if you give them your zone. 
Lots of work required when attempting to shut down (or slow down) the Aves - we didn't have it or were too caught up in the speed the Aves brought.
A team with the Jets talent level need to work hard and play a very structured game (defensive) if they want to compete with a team like the Aves."
"Whileee","Aug 3, 2024","I didn't reference the volume of turnovers per se, but rather the location and timing, and that wasn't based on stats per se, but rather on observing play for many games. By the way, I think turnover stats are much more dubious than shot volumes and locations, which are more reliably measured.

As I noted above, a winger can indirectly contribute to high rates of high danger shots through more in-zone or neutral zone turnovers or failed zone exits that result in more rush chances or zone time against.

Regardless, the basic shot and goal stats very clearly show that the Jets give up more shots and goals against when Connor is on the ice, even after adjusting for score, venue, and players on the ice. It's too consistent to just be coincidence, so there must be an explanation, which is what I've tried to explain above.

Just to recap one basic statistic... Over the past 5 seasons at 5v5 opponents score against the Jets 1.8 times as often (on a per minute basis) when Connor is on the ice than when Ehlers is on the ice. That's based on over 5000 minutes for Connor and over 4000 minutes for Ehlers. It can't just be bad luck. I've explained why I think it happens. What would be your analysis and explanation as to why the Jets give up so many more goals when Connor is on the ice?"
"","Aug 3, 2024","The line is not good defensively - and as you noted, the biggest issue is zone exits.
A lot of that comes from the way that line plays in their own end - and the fact that 55 is not a good defensive center.
Lots of chaos where the defensive is unsupported by a center who will chip in on those puck battles - so the outlet is a ring around the boards to you know who. 
KC is not going to be effective on zone exits if he is trying to pick up outlets along the walls and in battle with a dman - he's not built for it and would be much more effective picking up open ice outlets and turning it up ice.
That rarely happens when that ""Line"" is on the ice."
"Buffdog","Aug 3, 2024","Ehlers is definitely elite at zone exits, but he also seems to turn pucks over at the offensive zone blueline. I'm not sure about the frequency, but I do notice it when it happens because coaches HATE turnovers at both bluelines because of the counterattack that they cause (the resto of the team is moving in the wrong direction)

As for the scoring rates, I'd be curious to see how much the gap narrows once stregth of competition is controlled for. It seems obvious that Ehlers makes the top line better vs Connor, but usually ehlers is either being played with Schief and Connor or Connor is injured. There haven't been many instances where they've swapped spots... but Connor Monahan Perfetti was a great line in the limited minutes they got when Bones reunited ESL"
"Whileee","Aug 3, 2024","After adjusting for teammates and competition, the Jets still give up way more goals and expected goals per 60 minutes when Connor is on the ice."
"Jet","Aug 3, 2024","I was going to say. 

Connor doesn't turn the puck over much. If he doesn't have a play, he flips it deep and pursues it. 

He doesn't really have much risk in his game when he has the puck on his stick. 

His problem is getting the puck back (or even just out) when it's in our zone. 

He is pretty good at stripping pucks though."
"","Aug 3, 2024","I would call his position a mitigating factor in the impact. Just like him playing with Scheifele is a mitigating factor.

If you think the characterization of him being poor defensively is unfair, I'm open to hearing why. Same with Scheifele, who does play center, I guess.

Even with that said... I feel like labeling him poor, below average, not great with negligible impact as F1, etc isn't the point.

Most folks here the issue is Scheifele and Connor both not being good defensively, so it compounds their respective issues. The issue is when those two us our top line, that line is not very good. Like at all. Among the worst top lines in the NHL.

Edit: after re-reading my post I feel a need to double down here. I was emphasizing the need to split up Scheifele and Connor in defending Connor's value to the team.

""Using stats to create a narrative"" is a pretty much saying that I am full of shit lol

How do you feel about Connor and Scheifele together vs Ehlers and Scheifele? Is that a made up narrative? Or just the part about Connor?"

"","Aug 3, 2024","The better question might be, why is KC better with other centers - and why is 55 better with other wingers
The answers have been discussed to death - 
KC will be better playing with a center that is decent defensively.
55 will be better with a winger who can take care of outlets with minimal playmaking involved (Ehlers).

And mitigating factors are important if you want to dig into issues and sort out the ""whys"""
"voyageur","Aug 4, 2024","I remember Dave Lowry saying Adam likes having a RH shot on his line. Why I could only speculate.

I like the winger combos for the top 6. I think you should be able to switch centers between them and still have success."
"","Aug 4, 2024","I agree - and I think you and I have discussed this in the past - if 55 puts the effort in, his minutes likely would decrease anyway.

-Thinks Perfetti is just scratching the surface and has integrated himself into the core in the room.

-Needs young players to step up and help push team forward. Thinks Lambert and Chibrikov should factor sooner then later.

- Pumped Stanley's tires but also indicated its up to the young dmen like him and Ville to grab the positions that are open.

-Excited about the coaching staff and the fresh special team perspectives.

May have taken a subtle shot at McGroarty by pumping up the Moose and its role in development and naming top players for us that went through it.

Seems like the orgs view align with where I'm at. The core is aging and need an injection of young skill to keep things moving forward."

No doubt the organization wants its prospects to come through the Moose development tract but they now look to have a couple ready taking that track with clear roster spots available."
"KingBogo","Aug 8, 2024","Agreed I think there was a growing disconnect between Chevy’s long term plans and Bones’ short term roster decisions.

Chevy has also talked about youth integration a number of times this summer. 

Bones had a very unique mandate imo. He was always only seen as short term and his primary objectives were to fix a broken room and implement a defensive foundation. I think things like youth integration were down on the priority list he was given.

I'd expect Arniel has a very different set of objectives."
"surixon","Aug 8, 2024","We were told multiple times by multiple people Cole handled it like a pro. I'm sure he'll be better for it but I also think mistakes were made by both coach and GM alike.

Even with the deadline moves we had options for different types of combinations and philosophys Bones elected not to try. 

I think it's very possible that while Chevy did go put and get other players to give the team a boost he also wasn't satisfied with Cole sitting as well. Both can be correct."
"Bigfish","Aug 8, 2024","Chevy is the boss. It's his team. He hires and fires coaches, not the other way around. If he wanted Cole to play Cole would of played."
"surixon","Aug 8, 2024","That isn't what has been presented to us. A number of media have indicated that the relationship is that Chevy sets the roster and the coach decides how to use it.

We saw this play out a few years ago with Cehvy stating to the media that he wanted Ville to play and then we had Maurice fire back in the media and then choose not to play him. 

Coaches and GMs aren't always aligned and a winning team isn't firing a coach a month before the playoffs because there isn't full agreement in how the roster gets used."
"WolfHouse","Aug 8, 2024","Yeah Chevy does not seem like a handsome on GM... or maybe Chipman has a direct line to the coaches...

"WaveRaven","Aug 8, 2024","Yes true but when you tell a coach to make playoffs they're going to play it safe. Yutes aren't the safe play. I believe why you see them continuously getting vets and playing them over youngsters.

This team isn't good enough to shelter youngsters like Dallas. Like I said we shall see. But no way do they want to take any step back."
"KingBogo","Aug 8, 2024","But if your youth are ready you don’t have to take a step back. That is why you have your own farm team so your young players can step in and be an instant upgrade if they are developmentally ready. It has been an effective model for many organizations, you just need a coach who buys into the plan. My guess is Arniel wouldn’t have gotten the job if he didn’t buy into Chevy’s plan."
"surixon","Aug 8, 2024","Yup, and there are currently two roster spots open. One on defense and one upfront.

My guess is Lambert will get a chance to win the spot in camp upfront and Ville likely has the spot on defense."
"WaveRaven","Aug 8, 2024","IF they're ready. I don't see Lambert being a second line center on a playoff team yet. I'd be shocked at him actually playing there. Perfetti had a year under his belt and it was a short leash. So what spot not Ehlers, the 4th line ? Unsure they'll put him there.

It will be Names at 2c he's the best option right now. Ville/Stan should get a shot but they've brought in vet backup. They've shown a reluctance in the past and I don't think it's just going to change all the sudden."

Meanwhile this offseason, the nhl roster is 90% the same to start last year (adding miller and a new backup goalie - 2 vets).
And essentially 100% the same to start at fwd (at this point) , and they tried signing Monahan or Henrique and trading young players for Necas. Hmmm"

I’d reframe it as job security in a non job security gig for Arniel and Cheveldayoff."
"surixon","Aug 8, 2024","I mean how many coaches out there get hired that don't buy into the vision laid out by their boss? 

Clearly a coach should be given enough autonomy to do his job. But I imagine every coach who gets hired is given sub objectives by their GM that they need to hit. In terms of Arniel some of it looks to be improve the special teams and give some of the youth better roles or in the case of rookies opportunities if they show ready."

"surixon","Aug 8, 2024","I don't really disagree with you. We could use some fresh perspective. But I can understand why they operate the way they do. We've seen far too many undesirable markets stuck in never ending rebuilds.

We are between a rock and a hard place. We likely can only get truly elite talent by bottoming out, but we don't have the desirability to bring in the Hossa's, Panarin's etc to provide the high end vet talent to support the elite talent. We'd more then likely just be another Buffalo."
"","Aug 9, 2024","It’s an interesting debate and although there is a hint of frustration and possible cynicism in your post it’s not unfounded.

Looking back:

When the Jets arrived for the 2011-12 season Atlanta had just come off integrating Bogosian, Kane, and Burmi in their big rebuild (flop) all as 18 year olds. Zero delayed gratification for the fans hungering for the youth movement.

Then there was the lull. After Burmi it would take three seasons for the Jets to integrate their next prospect Schief and Trouba 2013-14 but that began the golden era of prospect integration up to Connor in 17-18. That group of prospects largely drove a bottom 13 NHL team to 2nd OA in the NHL and a cup contender.

That begot the dark age starting after Connor . Our drafting kind of went in the tank due to later picks, missing on picks, and more picks traded away. Stan, K-Ves, Jack,……..there was no real integration after Connor 17-18. The Next guy to come along that showed even a remote promise of playing top 6 fwd or top 4 D was Samberg in 2022-23. That was a half a decade slump and it explains why we don’t have the young pieces to get this core over the top.

However, I think starting with Perfetti we have begun to add some prospects that are not as rich and deep as our golden age but they are better than the dark ages. We have had two set backs that don’t help with McG doing the heel turn and Chaz looking like he is too fragile for Ice hockey but we still have a few interesting assets that “may be of help” over the next couple of seasons. Chipman’s panic boner doesn’t really help prospect integration as he brings in 80 year old coaches and trades draft capital to try to sell empty seats today but……..

The reality is the golden era core will age out over the next 3-5 seasons so the win now and forever strategy can only be fueled by shuffling the deck chairs for so long. The only practical way to re-build a core in Winnipeg is to hit on draft picks."
"surixon","Aug 9, 2024","Well said!"
"WolfHouse","Aug 9, 2024","Panic boner and circle jerk all in one thread. What a time to be alive!"
"","Aug 9, 2024","IMO, Chevy is talking youth at this point because that is what is available to him - his adds are gone, he lost a dman, and another was bought out based on contract / performance - so the holes are open. I don't see this as some grand plan that Chevy came up with - and there is no way of assuming it is long term - it looks more to me like a reaction to stuff that happened, . The Jets will probably continue to tinker to make the PO's and that may include more deadline deals that Chevy thinks will help. 
I'd like to believe there is some sort of long term plan in play - but I don't buy it. This team will likely continue with the game plan that means making the PO's and if the youth can help in that, they will be a pce of the plan - if not, they will look elsewhere."
"","Aug 9, 2024","That a dark take but likely accurate - 
IMO, it comes down to this:
Will the Jets stick to a plan that integrates more youth in the lineup - no matter what.
Or does the plan adapt to our place in the standings?
Chevy and the Jets will react to what they think they need to do to make the PO's - and they'll do that on the fly.
I don't see ""Long Term planning"" in the mix -"
"WolfHouse","Aug 9, 2024","Without the rumours of his failed contract offers during UFA, it would be easier to believe... but trying to keep Monahan and then offering a contract to Henrique is not integrating youth"
"surixon","Aug 9, 2024","Yes I imagine a good amount of this is reactionary to striking out in FA. It just highlights the fact this org had been in full blown reactionary mode for a number of years now. It starts at the top with Chipman being in full blown panic mode with ticket sales and that trickles down to hockey opps making knee Jerk short term moves. 

But the market has spoken and Chevy and Co really don't have much choice but to put some trust in the kids. I'm sure he's more bullish on some then others.

Should be an interesting year."
"WolfHouse","Aug 9, 2024","TNSE wasn't in panic mode with season tickets when we were chasing Timo Meier and other guys before that... It does seem like our draft develop strategy really was thrown out when we made the finals - and replaced with no strategy."
"Heldig","Aug 9, 2024","It has been talked about for a while but a draft and develop team that has had very few draft picks - as a result of trading futures for immediate help (that did not help) - whilst failing with numerous draft picks in the last 5 years or so - and here we are.

"","Aug 9, 2024","I agree -
This is not a Long Term Plan of any sort - it's Chevy shifting the message to suit the situation.
He has holes in the lineup that need to be filled - so now we are on a ""integrate the youth"" movement - lol."

"WolfHouse","Aug 9, 2024","We might barely hit 100 points this year. Ugh."
"surixon","Aug 9, 2024","I imagine the plan was always to give Snerg and Cole larger roles and get Ville into the fold. But my thinking is they had originally wanted to give Lambert and Chibrikov another year on the Moose. My guessing is they now feel they may need to advance one of the two a year."
"","Aug 9, 2024","The sooner that Chipman and the gang realize that performance wasn't why they are bleeding ticket sales, the sooner they stop making those short term moves. It's not the team, it's how the organization treated the fans that were ponying up their hard earned dollars for season tickets. They burned an awful lot of bridges with fans that afford season tickets. Very few of those fans are returning."
"surixon","Aug 9, 2024","Yup, they need to fix their customer service. If they can't retain good ticket reps then maybe they should seriously look to outsource it to a third party that specializes in client engagement.

I think they are aware of the issue but seemingly don't know how to fix it in-house."
"DRW204","Aug 9, 2024","Not frustration at anything a gm says. I'm just firmly in the ""see it to beleive it"" camp when it comes to most things sports gm's or coaches say. Rather than eating the smallest shit up which hf sometimes does.

Folks on this forum routinely take small smidges of uncontexualized interviews, quotes and then apply it as a gospel, or concrete as if things remain static through an entire sports season. Secondly, anyone can say anything and have it printed and ran with. I'll hold legitimate actions in higher regard such as transactions or even transaction attempts.

So, color me extremely unsurprised that at the HLKINA, a tournament headlined by prospects, that a hockey executive is talking about their prospects as a primary conversation point. Like gee great nugget to unearth!

Meanwhile, they've brought back nearly the entire group to start last year and signed or attempted to sign vets (the horror!!!) as additional or replacement pieces, while still being a team hopeful of cup contention.

Can a prospect or 2 be in the lineup to start, sure. I hardly quantify this as movement, and is something teams do frequently. Hardly anything exciting or noteworthy imo."
"","Aug 9, 2024","I see this take often but very rarely do people say what actually put them off. I expect there is a not insignificant portion of people who were selling tickets to make back some of their cost and that market dried up.

I can afford season tickets more now than I could when I had them but my lifestyle just doesn't fit that anymore. Nothing to do with how I was treated since my interaction with the reps was minimal. I'm also not interested in buying them during a rebuild if that happens."
"","Aug 9, 2024","Part of the issue is that they can retain good ticket reps - they can, do and then promote them. Meaning the ticket rep position is forever an entry level position with very high turnover. That's the face/voice/email the average (so anyone NOT in a box) fan gets to interact with. They are mostly young adults, fresh out of a business program. 

The position itself is also thankless which invariably leads to the turnover as well. I've heard lots of stories about season ticket holders berating ticket reps over the phone for moves Chevy did, or didn't, make. So I'm sympathetic to them and the challenges they face but the longest I ever had a ticket rep was about 15 months. As I've posted previously I'm on my 4th in the last twelve months. 

I swear it's the used car salesman model and it's a poor choice for this type of organization. 

That said the ticket reps are the least of the orgs problems as they're mostly well meaning young men and women not really cut out for that type of position in most cases. And I don't mean that as a slight to them, it's a difficult position. 

The biggest mistake they made, IMO, is undervaluing those STH they had. There was always bound to be turnover as some that initially got tickets were in for a quick buck. Once that dried up those ticket holders left, but I'd guess that's maybe 10% or less of STH and they were easily replaceable. So it's the treatment of the other 90% that were the issue and the stories I've heard from many are the same. In a nutshell TNSE was utterly unresponsive to any of their concerns and consideration for those concerns was negligible at best. The communication was channeled through the ticket reps so they get the blame, but it is organizational.

TNSE has acknowledged they are to blame to some degree but the behaviors remain precisely the same as they were previously. The organization is basically behaving like a government bureaucracy - those in charge are never in danger of losing their positions so there's not any meaningful change. Those in the upper echelon will tell you they are introspective and they're absolutely certain they aren't the problem. They've performed their due diligence and looked at what is happening and even created a STH Council to help them. But like all self-serving bureaucracies they suffer from toxic positivity and discount any negative feedback as being only from whiners and pessimists. There's never actually any real introspection.


I've delineated it many times in the past and have had many conversations with individuals. I'm opting to not repeat myself but I'm quite happy to go into excruciating detail if you'd like. 

Respectfully I disagree with you on the proportion who were selling, I think it was insignificant, perhaps 10% that were reliant upon it. Certainly many have now opted to sell the higher demand games like Montreal and Toronto, but that's just about all that reaches that level of demand these days where you can make over your STH price (McDavid and Edmonton as well I suspect)."
"surixon","Aug 9, 2024","Ok, I've seen your point often enough to know what you deem to be missteps.

In your view what do they need to do repair it. What actual services, perks, engagement that are realistic need to be done.

Personally I have been seat holder since day one and really don't care much about all the other stuff. I guess I'm easy to please cause all I care about is attending the games. Things like contests, food and beverage choices are all secondary to me and I just choose to buy or not buy. I've also never really had a need to engage with the reps for things. I'm satisfied with the food and merch discount.

On some level I think maybe some people feel entitled to far more then what is realistic."
"","Aug 9, 2024","I'd be happy with 100 points if Lambert and Ville are on the team.

"","Aug 9, 2024","That is a sad assessment - but probably correct.

Judge people by what they do, not what they say. The goal will remain to simply make the PO and then hope to get some luck.

Apart from Miller in for Schmidt and Heinola being given a shot at 3LD we are simply running it back. And Stanley could very well still be the regular 3LD. The only questions are about who and how many will be in the press box."
"","Aug 9, 2024","DeMelo doesn't fit the mold for a 1RD or for a partner for Morrissey, yet he gets the job done at a pretty high level. Samberg isn't a replacement for Dillon's physicality but I'm pretty sure he will be a decent 3/4 Dman. Pionk is the weak link in our D corps.

Otherwise, top line that can't win its matchups. 2nd line that is actually a shut-down 3rd line .............. yeah, long season."
"","Aug 9, 2024","I've said it before. The reason I gave up my tickets was how I was treated. Period.

I never interacted with a ticket rep. As part of a group who liked their seats it was never necessary. It was a basket of practices that started with required purchase of pre-season games at regular season prices and ended with TNSE selling seats all around me for substantially less than what I was paying. And throwing in a free beer, or whatever.

There were other issues, but they were lesser irritants.

You aren't interested in buying them during a rebuild. I'm not sure I'm interested in buying them WITHOUT a rebuild."
"","Aug 9, 2024","Don't see the KC comparison. If it is valid then maybe he is a not so poor man's KC who scores less but has a better all around game. He plays a fiery game, which is what KC lacks. I see him as a more skilled Tanev."
"surixon","Aug 9, 2024","I'm mostly talking about his skills with the puck and instincts around the net. He does play with more jam off the puck. But has similar defensive deficiencies as KC."
"","Aug 9, 2024","OK. I think you could say the same about Tanev. Tenacious forechecker. Not so great defensively, though not KC bad."
"","Aug 9, 2024","We'll cancel each other out then. I don't want to spend $10k to watch them get blown out each night. 

I can appreciate the preseason game gripe. I don't agree with the anger over seats sold around for less. It was a promotion to get people in the building because those seats weren't moving otherwise. Your benefit is getting to every game for less and cheaper playoff tickets. Those deals weren't available for every game or every opponent either."
"Buffdog","Aug 9, 2024","Yeah, I see Chibs more as a ""rich man's Tanev"" than a ""poor man's Connor""

"scelaton","Aug 9, 2024","I wouldn't say you are just easy to please, but at ~ 50,000 posts it is clear that the Jets mean more to you than to most on this board, and 99% of Winnipeggers. You are atypical.

As for entitlement, it is everywhere these days, but does not describe our fan base particularly well. More than others, we know we are not ""entitled"" to a team and could lose them again, just like we did the first time. A big chunk of our vulnerability is simply numbers and dollars--we are a small city with a modest economic base. None of that is TNSE's fault.

BUT. TNSE could have done much, much better. There is a sense of entitlement in the organization itself that has bred complacency and ingratitude. They know how much the Jets are valued and were spoiled rotten, literally, by a seeming insatiable demand the first number of years after the return.

Put simply, they needed to try harder to please and be more grateful to their customer base. ps241 and others who are in business will know exactly what I am saying. You have to treat every (decent) customer as the potential key to your future success. Or ultimately, you will fail.

Of course, putting out a winning lineup is a the most obvious way to increase fan engagement, but if the ST base ( and general fanbase) respect the organization, there is a lot more latitude to, eg, take chances with youth and make other strategic decisions with a degree of risk attached.

I have had a lot of contact with TNSE, as a STH and also professionally. I gave up my share of ST a few years ago because I have many other ways of seeing games live, but also because of the air of indifference emanating from the organization. There appear to be two clubs-- the young men's club (ie, the players) and the old boys club--if you are not in either club, you are invisible.

That started to change these past couple of years, inside and outside the dressing room, but they still have a lot of work to do and a lot of culture to change."

"surixon","Aug 9, 2024","Thanks for sharing."
"Whileee","Aug 9, 2024","Probably correct about a lot of this, but I also think that the Jets have some good prospects that now have considerable AHL experience. They weren't reluctant to integrate Roslovic, Connor and Appleton after good AHL performances during their previous contender window. Heinola has a lot of AHL experience with good results. Lambert just completed a season that is at least as good as Roslovic's season before he had a decent run with the Jets, and that was on the stacked 2017/18 team.

So it would fit with previous approaches to consider using players like Heinola, Lambert and Chibrikov in the NHL line-up, at least for good chunks of the season. I think we might see a situation where the Jets integrate young players into the line-up in the first half, and then perhaps look at adding key pieces at the TDL if they feel they need more experience / impact. If McGroarty has a really strong season he might return a good roster player with some term at the TDL, which might be one of Chevy's considerations."

To be honest I find your comment regarding entitlement to be a little condescending. It's likely not meant that way intentionally but it's how I perceive it. It demeans the very real issues I and many other have faced when dealing with TNSE (guy with cancer asks to transfer his tickets to another member of the group and they ask for $1400 to do so? F$ck right off. Even Westjet didn't bat an eye or ask for proof). I'm pleased you've had no issues ever and I wish that had been my experience, but it's not and it's not for many others I know.

I too have been a STH from day one, Section 112 and tried to move my seats from the very first day in those P3 seats. It took me 7+ years and likely doesn't happen without my association with this board and the kindness of a board member that provided me his name, old and new seat locations that moved from P6 to better seats in P3 before me. Prior to providing that information to my ticket rep, they told me I was lying. After providing the names and seat locations I was moved to Section 103 within 2 days.

How can they repair it? I don't believe they can; not with STH they've lost. People are fine with getting cheaper tickets to the vast majority of games and not having to deal with the inconsistent treatment from TNSE.

Burning out the flippers was likely always expected and I have no issue with that. Burning out the folks that had/have the disposable income to afford STH in a declining economy is the opposite of sound business practices (you'll excuse me if I don't concern myself with budget issues).

What can they do moving forward? Value their customers. Don't undercut their STH:

1. don't sell seats next to a STH for LESS than the STH pays and provide the perk (?) of a beer and a hotdog that the STH doesn't get. You want to do that for your walk ups? Step up and offer it to the STH as well. Yeah, it doesn't happen every game but it happens at most of the non-A games (perhaps not on Friday or Saturday night - so ballpark 50% of the games). As for non-STH NOT getting into the game for less as a STH? That's complete bullshit. I pay $130 a seat for my seats and I've frequently sat beside people getting in for $85 plus the beer/hot dog. Yes, I have priority access to playoff tickets. What's that again, we qualify roughly every other year or slightly less? Big perk there. Thanks, but I'll take the $45 x 22 games = $990 in savings over the season.

2. Don't mandate me via the contract to sell my tickets on your official site for  than I paid when you're selling the seats next to me for under STH pricing. Sometimes seats have to be moved (work travel, illness, etc.) and I can't list my tickets for what TNSE is. That's flat out horseshit. Yeah, I can sell on fansfirst or whatever, but TNSE reserves the right to revoke my STH license if they're in the mood to do so. Our group has listed tickets at our price, only to be undersold by TNSE at a lower price. We have your money, $%^& you STH is the message.

3. Make some actual effort to keep actual records of your STH requests for relocation.
The Bombers were able to do this in the era of rulers, graph paper and rotary dial telephones. I was at the point of requesting a relocation every 3 months due to ticket rep turnover and being told ""we have nothing on file"". When I re-emailed my request they'd apologize and do nothing. I'm not delusional, but I do want to feel like I matter and that my concerns that are reasonable are recorded and some effort is made. See above regarding my move from 112-103. There should be a file for each set of ST but I do not believe there is. When moving to half season this year for the first time since the Jets returned, my ST rep suggested I move to section 112 because section 103 was too good for half season. I've been a STH since 2011 and I don't carry any weight at all? Really? That's going to encourage me to re-up? Come on. I fought for seven years to get out of that section and you're telling me that 103 is high demand (it's not, trust me).

4. Be responsive to your clientele. I lost a guy from my group because he got tired of lining up at the box office to pick up his tickets because he was retired and didn't want a smartphone. Yeah, I know, but you know what? The Vancouver Canucks to this day still print tickets (at additional cost) for the clientele that want it. My brother in law was a partner in a law firm in Vancouver that gave tickets to clients for their business. He retired last year so I don't know if it's current for this year but up until 2023-24 it was a thing.
I worked in the restaurant industry a long time decades ago and those that I know that are still there (mods ask if you want names) have all dumped their tickets with the switch to electronic ticketing because it's too annoying (as in the customers don't want to give their emails to the restaurant because they then expect incoming spam marketing) and inconvenient to give valued customers and/or staff a reward. I can give you several chains in Winnipeg that dropped their STH packs because of this. The tickets were used to reward staff, frequent customers. That's cutting out a corporate partner essentially.
It's not that hard, find a way to print, watermark/protect those tickets in some way, charge more and you feed that clientele. I fully acknowledge that's the way of the future, but you know what? How many Millenials have that disposable income at this point? Face it, you burned Boomer/Gen X clientele and those are the actual people with the disposable income. Well played.

I've lost many more people in my group over the years because they've simply looked at the economics and realized that they can pay full price to see Edmonton or whoever they really want to see and then go to a number of other games for under STH price in similar seats and end up saving money versus being part of a STH group and paying the $130 for P3. The penalty for that economic decision is possibly/maybe paying more to see the playoffs that they're probably not attending anyway. Tough economic times and they're winning overall. TNSE taking the short view when they should be playing long is the simple explanation. I mean how do you grow up and succeed in Winnipeg and so severely misunderstand your market?

I don't care about free merch, etc. The discounts are better (it was pretty sad when the waitlist was getting the same discount as my $10K a year payment). Contests are utterly irrelevant (would you like the name of a guy I know that has been STH of the game twice). It's something of a strawman to contend that it's the lack of perks that keep people from being a STH - do you really think there are that many people that if they got a free jersey they'd drop several thousand dollars? I suppose that's actually probably true given how many people fall for the ""points"" scams that are offered by many grocery retailers. 

TNSE overestimated its ability to piss people off and they are reaping the rewards of their behavior. As mentioned, to me it's literally the used car sleazy salesman market. Once they have your money the follow up is severely lacking. That's an ok model for people out there that you can burn the experience with; other car dealers exist, many with the same model of business so people get hooped. That's not the case with the Jets. Winnipeggers are inherently cheap and are by and large not stupid. Why would someone pay $130 for STH in P3 to see preseason games, Utah games in late January at 2:00 on a Sunday afternoon when the team probably isn't in the mood (trust me, I've so many lacklustre efforts) when the alternative is to pick games you want and so long as it's not Friday/Saturday or a handful of teams they're ultimately paying less. Yeah, they might miss out on a playoff game but I've yet to see the Jets win a home game (luck of the draw) in the playoffs and have seen them eliminated three times. Whoo-whoo. I have lots of white towels though.

And no, I don't really want the Bud and hotdog. That will come back on me.

Provide value and people will come to you. Screw them and they walk away. I think there have been a few movies over the years espousing similar principles. Chipman and crew didn't learn that lesson. Yet."

"","Aug 10, 2024","To each their own.

Access to PO tickets doesn't appeal to me. I will never spend that much for 1 night's entertainment. Just can't make myself do it.

I certainly wouldn't spend $10k either. I was in a ticket group for a lot less than that.

If they are going to keep offering promo deals, I will buy some of them instead of ST. But not having committed to x number of dates before the season began leads to going to fewer games. I am disincentivized to buy ST. I think there were deals for most games.

I understand the marketing need for the deals but it is a 2 edged sword. Discounts devalue your product. Once you start doing it, it becomes very hard to stop unless you can sell out without them.

I can watch a struggling team if they are moving towards getting better. It is no worse than watching a team that makes the PO most years and gets blown out in the 1st rd. If they are getting blown out most nights and not progressing that is another matter.

The PO blowout demonstrated that the 4th OA finish last regular season was an aberration. My guesstimate is that they were more like 12th best in the league. Being content with that and simply making the PO most years doesn't sell to me. I can only speak for myself but there must be others who feel the same way.

I want to see an org that is fighting, kicking, biting and scratching to win the Cup. They don't need to ever actually attain that goal but they do need to be striving for it, always. As long as they are doing that I will buy tickets to watch."

"voyageur","Aug 10, 2024","He mentioned Stanley, who is not a young player anymore by NHL standards, probably mid career for the average. Heinola makes the team, still have to see how he gets used. I don't think there is a direction from management to play certain players. Arniel might be able to coach young players better than Bowness, but we'll see how much rope they get. I think the name of the game is make your impression in TC, make it hard to be cut or demoted. And then help the team accumulate points, early the season. If you get sent down you fight to be the next man up, when opportunity knocks. 

This season has a different feel to it...there may be some confidence left over from last year's run, with some chemistry built, and an opportunity for young players to contribute. Like Johnson in Dallas or Faber in Minnesota are doing, two picks where the Jets at this point missed out on the better player in their draft spot. Lambert seems like that guy who could move the needle. I think he and Heinola are the best chances at success. 

But this team has proven to be fragile when things go wrong, and you wonder if the youth push doesn't become a showcase if this isn't the Jets year, and all those UFAs get moved."
"cbcwpg","Aug 13, 2024","Winnipeg Jets winger Nikolaj Ehlers will be making an early return to competitive hockey this year as he suits up for Denmark in Olympic qualifying later this month.

Jets head coach Scott Arniel confirmed to the Winnipeg Sun that Ehlers will play as Denmark hosts the Group F qualifying tournament as they take on Great Britain, Japan and Norway. The winner of the group will clinch their spot in the 2026 Olympics in Italy.

“Playing in these qualifiers, I know it’s going to be a big boost in getting him started, getting off and running and getting off to a good start in October,” Arniel added."

"KingBogo","Aug 13, 2024","This makes sense for Ehlers since he is still under contract for this season. Less so for Perfetti as he is unlikely to be in camp without a contract. You'd think they would want that done with a little room to spare before camp."

"surixon","Aug 13, 2024","I can't seem to find it.

What did Arniel specifically say with regards to contracts for Cole and Fly and did he give reasons for not wanting Vilardi and Cole in the middle.

Seems to me they are going risk adverse suppression mode and hoping improved special teams will tilt the balance in our favor."
"KingBogo","Aug 13, 2024","Arniel didn't say anything about contracts. Chevy's job. He said he likes Perfetti at wing. After that he talked about giving some young guys a look in camp.

Not surprised that Namestnikov is the front runner for 2C. Jets did pretty good with him in that role last year, statistically better than with Monahan. 


Lambert is probably going to have to blow the doors off to get the job. Maybe if Valardi goes down again, they put him in the 2C spot with Namestnikov insulating him on the wing. Going forward I think the Jets, after last season's development, want to see Lambert grow into that 2C spot, and his skating will make him a better option for that role...Scheifele and Lowry are good skaters, but not elite. Perfetti might be a level below them. I think the Jets definitely want an upper echelon skater in their centre folds, to compete with some pretty good ones in the conference. I also wonder what kind of forecheck the Jets use, with their centres being among the most physical players on the roster, and Lambert is again probably better than Perfetti in that regard, even if a tad undersized still."

I definitely get that second part and it seems our strategy is to only have one offensive center and the a bunch of defensive first ones. I can't say I'm thrilled about this strategy but it worked last year so I can understand them doing so again. I don't think it's a recipe for long term playoff success though.

Just seems we are getting a more conservative approach again. I'd like to see more proactive decisions and for the org to take some real risks.



I think it's more defense that they want then speed in the center spot. They had no issue trying to bring back slow as molasses Monohan for that role."
"voyageur","Aug 13, 2024","I'm hoping new coaches have an impact with team speed this year. Lambert and Kupari are elite skaters, Namestnikov is a skater.

This year really lends itself to the potential that we have as a team."
"Whileee","Aug 13, 2024","The Jets have the cap space to sign Perfetti to a long-term contract, and I would think that they have considered it strongly. Chevy and the Jets have created some good cap situations with these long-term bargains (like Scheifele, Connor and Ehlers). 

On the other hand, if they give Perfetti a bridge deal, they can build up a lot of cap space in case they want to make a splash at the TDL (perhaps with McGroarty as a trade chip). They might be in position to acquire a higher-end roster player who has some contract term at that point if they keep the cap space open."
"surixon","Aug 13, 2024","Even if Cole inks long term they should still start the year roughly a couple million under the cap. They can still accrue enough to do what I'm sure is the plan and go big game hunting for whowever they feel they can get to be the 2C at the deadline.

My opinion is that if both sides wanted a bridge deal it would be done by now. My guess is they are talking long term and will only resort to a bridge if they can't agree on a value that works for both on a 7 year deal."
"surixon","Aug 13, 2024","I'd love to see that, but I'm just getting the vibe from what I'm hearing that Arniel is going to double down on Bones's system and philosophy at 5 on 5. It seems the only real change he speaks of is special teams. Seems like same line configurations etc. 

We will just have to wait until camp."
"Whileee","Aug 13, 2024","I have no problem with the 5v5 system the Jets used last season. They were excellent in the first half of the season, creating a ton of pressure and very good defensive structure. It showed in their metrics and results. I actually think that they took a bit of a downturn in performance in the second half. I attribute some of that to re-uniting Connor with Scheifele and Vilardi, and then adding Monahan and demoting Namestnikov made them less effective at implementing the high-speed pressure system, with lots of back-pressure. You can see it in the shot metrics (top chart below). In the first half, they were generally much higher in xG for than xG against, but then had a slump at about mid-season. They turned it around again later in the season, especially defensively."
"surixon","Aug 13, 2024","I'd like to see them modify it a bit in the ozone and on breakouts. I'm fine with the forecheck and play off the puck in the nz and dz. 

But it seems this scheme puts a lot of focus on defense for the centers not named Mark. If we run similarly then it likely isn't the best use for Cole to focus mostly on defense as a center. 

My main issue is it sounds like KC, Mark and Gabe will once again be a thing. As your chart points out they essentially negate a good amount of what the other lines do by hemeraging goals and chances. That to me juat reeks of same old same old by the org. I can't see our 5 on 5 play being great again if they get 20 minutes a game again."

"WaveRaven","Aug 14, 2024","Names as 2 c"
"Whileee","Aug 14, 2024","I think the reality is that Lowry functions as the 2C, with Namestnikov's line being more of a 2/3 line.

I'd like to see the Jets try a bit more offense with Lowry to balance out scoring a bit in the middle 6 as the Panthers and Canes do with Bennett and Staal, who are defensively-oriented Cs like Lowry. Both of them have strong offensive players on their lines, so maybe putting a more offensive RW with Lowry and Nino would be a good option, and balance with Namestnikov's line."
"Huffer","Aug 14, 2024","That's an option as well and something I've thought about too. The idea of putting some more offensive wingers with Lowry (although they would still need to be strong defensively due to the assignments they'd get).

Regardless of whether we're saying 2C or 3C though, it feels like we need a long term solution in the ""non Scheifele or Lowry"" top 9 C role. Looks like Lambert as of now."

I wonder what that looks like. Both wingers have high offensive upside but also defensive awareness. 

One thing I did notice in Arniel's comments about Ehlers is that he said that Nik is making progress in playing the way they want him to in terms of getting the puck back when the other teams have it. Makes you wonder what they see that a lot of Ehlers fans on the board don't"

"Hobble","Aug 14, 2024","The Jets really need to work on their C drafting, especially if they start moving them to wing by default. Agreed that soon enough we’ll need to be developing replacements for Scheif and Lowry, and we don’t have 3 1st round picks every year to trade for rental Cs."
"DRW204","Aug 14, 2024","yeah it seems that way. at the beg. of the off-season it seems like the initial plan was re-signing Monahan as a UFA. that didn't work out, and they were apparently in on Henrique after that."
"KingBogo","Aug 14, 2024","So what do you see happening? Scheifele making $8.5 M as the 4th line center and Lowry captaining from the PB?"
"surixon","Aug 14, 2024","Both will be around 34 then, what do you think they'll actually be capable of by then? 

Adam isn't signed past the next two seasons. My guess is you reassess where he is before ponnying up big cash for a 33 year old.

I have long since believed that Mark will have to be moved to wing in his mid 30's to salvage value out of that deal. He's already fading and isn't good defensively, that is only going to become more pronounced over the next few years.

But hey if the org is super stubborn and leave them in those roles like with Wheeler then we get that tank some on here want."

"KingBogo","Aug 14, 2024","I think they will expect Scheifele to be a top 6 center for at least the 1st 5 years of his contract, ideally being bumped to #2 in 3 or 4 years if a prospect like Lambert clicks at center. I’m guessing Lowry will be re-signed after this contract at a slightly lower AAV and remain in a bottom 6 center role and team captain with less and hard matching as time goes on."
"drumzan","Aug 14, 2024","A good part of this is because Chevy sticks with BPA and refuses to move up/down in draft.

Sticking to BPA leads you to drafting a bunch of Wingers and LHD’s.

"KingBogo","Aug 14, 2024","I never considered that comparison and it is an interesting thought. But what I think is we are now seeing in his play is what some of the early scouting reports of him talked about. Near perfect skating style with matching speed and the ability to control the puck at speed. Playing with men too early held him back IMO. The organization hit a home run allowing him to play with peers with the Thunderbirds in 22/23. The kid needed to feel offense again. He then carried that forward with the Moose last season. I’m really looking forward to what we see from him in camp."

Unless there is a training camp injury not a lot of doors open..that said the Jets way seems to be build chemistry, and hope for results with familiarity. 3rd defensive pair is maybe only the real fresh start next season.

Moose ran Lambert with AJF quite a bit last year...Conceivably JAD is Malott's replacement.

Toninato and Chibrikov were together quite a bit too...I see Lucius as the centre there.

You probably have Mason Shaw and Parker Ford as your checking line wingers. Both can play in the NHL. Shaw is going to replace some of the toughness Viel brought last year, I'd say with a better chance of a callup.

Checking line centre is a mystery. Julien might get a look there...Nikkanen had a strong finish, and he's good on the dot.

Where a guy like Zhilkin fits in is a mystery to me. You need playing time for prospects. But also competition. Jets and Moose should have competitive camps but seems like there a few guys who need opportunity to get to the next level."
"","Aug 15, 2024","He doesn't need to be elite to be more than a 50/60 pt center.

"","Aug 15, 2024","Improved ST could make a pretty bug difference - but  needs to play 2C. Or are we going to go 2F & 3D and just concede all of the FO?"
"surixon","Aug 15, 2024","It's going to need to because I don't expect by far league best goaltending this year."
"voyageur","Aug 15, 2024","Since Little went down in 2019, Jets have drafted Perfetti, Lucius, Mc Groarty and Lambert in the 1st round. 3 of the 4 may be NHL centres down the road, not all with the Jets. At the very least Mc Groarty could return a potential 2C under contract too as a trade chip."
"surixon","Aug 15, 2024","I think it's more the Jets need to revamp their center development plan"
"voyageur","Aug 15, 2024","Maybe but Perfetti I think was always seen as more likely to be a winger because his skating wasn't top notch...Lundell would have been the centre pick in the spot the Jets were in... Lucius I believe has been developed as a centre the whole way, you can't predict injuries, maybe with better DNA testing you could, but let's not go there...Lambert has stayed in the middle through his development, as far as I know. Wouldn't be surprised if the Jets wanted Mc Groarty to take centre reps in the A, to grow into that role...Another one you couldn't predict. So last time the Jets traded a 1st for a centre before Monahan was 2019 , and the guys that were drafted in Heinola's range were Tomasino and Mc Michael, not sure that's the answer. 2017 I suppose the Jets missed out on Suzuki or Josh Norris. Hard to say Laine, Connor and Ehlers weren't good picks."
"","Aug 15, 2024","What do you see in 3 years if Scheif and Lowry are still 2 of our top 9 C's?"
"surixon","Aug 15, 2024","This goes back much further then those you mentioned though.

Roslovic was developed similarly to Lambert with similar AHL results. He gets to the show and he's put on the wing and never really trialed at center. They instead put Wheeler and others in the middle. Same thing with Copp. Stays at wing despite clearly being capable of being a middle 6 C as we've seen since he left.

This org doesn't seem to have the patience no matter who it is to stick with them as a center. 

It would he the same with Lundell if he were here instead of Cole. 

Development doesn't just happen prior to the NHL. There is a learning curve at the NHL that this org just refuses to live with."
"voyageur","Aug 15, 2024","You can really never have enough centres in your lineup. Dallas is a good example. Little was always a better centre than Roslovic, especially on the dot, so when the time came for Roslovic to move from 4C to 2C, he didn't exactly run away with the job, and has never held it consistently in his career...Wheeler was better choice, at that time. Copp as a 2C has never panned out, but still remains the best return you could get for a borderline 2C in crunch time. It's nice to have these guys when players go down. Like Big Adam Lowry, because you don't miss a beat in replacement level. 

2C has been the most talked about position with the Jets even before Little went down. Brad Lambert to me seems like the answer here. Maybe it's another development year, maybe half a year. Maybe it's right out of camp. A healthy year from Lucius and he might even have some competition down the road. Checking line centres, and 4th line centres are in the pipeline. Jets may turn Barron into a centre down the road, which is the least valued piece of the Copp deal. Jets did have a lag in centre drafting and development, after 2011, but the team we started with wasn't very good at too many positions. I'd say they are getting with the program now."
"surixon","Aug 15, 2024","Little went down early in 2020 and they never gave Copp or Roslovic a shot. They went right to converting a career winger in his 30's.

They then went out and brought in Cody Eakin to be our 2C heading into the playoffs over what they had.

They then bring in a well passed his prime Stastny to play C instead of trusting their home grown players.

I like Lambert and think he can be a center but I have very little faith in this org actually giving him a legit opportunity to do it. Much like with Perfetti I feel if things don't go to plan quickly they will pull the plug and bring in the next mediocre vet to fill the hole. 

Nothing in the orgs history the last decade tells me otherwise."
"Whileee","Aug 15, 2024","I'll stay firmly on the Namestnikov bandwagon for the 2-3 C slot. It seems that Arniel likes him there, too. Maybe Arniel and the coaches are looking at the data to project him in that role.

Last season at 5v5 the lines centered by Lowry and Namestnikov were a combined +20 in goals and +16 in expected goals. When Namestnikov centered the 2/3 line the Jets were +10 in goals and +5 in expected goals, despite playing about half as much as Scheifele and Lowry at 5v5. In contrast, lines including Scheifele and Connor were -1 in goals and -8 in expected goals at 5v5.

Below is a quick graphic that shows how the Jets top 3 lines fared last season in GF% and xGF% (with time on ice as the bubble size).

My overall conclusion is that the Jets are fine in the middle-6 with Lowry and Namestnikov anchoring those lines. They need to solve the 1st line problem with Connor-Scheifele."
"","Aug 15, 2024","It needs to be a modified BPA with a multiplier based on position. C comes first, followed by RHD, LHD, RW, LW. Both wings can be back-filled with players drafted at C but who don't end up at C in the NHL.

That doesn't mean you never draft W. It means that W need to be clearly rated higher than the available talent at C & D, especially RHD."
"voyageur","Aug 15, 2024","Do you think Copp and Roslovic are legitimate 2Cs...neither of them have led teams to the playoffs in that role? Copp got lucky to centre Panarin and Strome for a stretch. But I remember there being a good discussion on here about his potential to centre Laine and Ehlers when Little couldn't do it, and most people believed he wasn't good enough. 

Realistically looking back at the 2020 season it's a miracle that team was even in competition for a playoff spot. Eakin didn't pan out, and I think it was Copp who replace Scheif after game 1, but if it wasn't for Wheeler's brief work in the middle, I don't think the Jets ever get Dylan De Melo as an addition to the team, so that's a win.

Stastny as 2C got the Jets to the playoffs. Dubois as 2C was 1 for 2, and out the door so fast the year he did, we couldn't say goodbye, so I'll take that trade. 

And here we are. You could be right on the future based on the past, but I hope the winds have changed."
"","Aug 15, 2024","In D+3 Barzal exceeded ppg in the NHL, not the AHL. Do you think Lambert can do that this coming season?"
"voyageur","Aug 15, 2024","I believe you are right here, but for reference could you compare the amount of d-zones starts for Scheifele vs. Namestnikov, because I am sure that is a factor in goals against. Are EN GA a factor too?"
"DRW204","Aug 15, 2024","Although Lowry GF% is high, their GF /60 is pretty pedestrian if I recall which isn't what you want for a top 6 line. Unless you're scheifeles line you will likely rate pretty well on the GA side given Helle is net.

IMO the second line needed to see more mins with Names"
"surixon","Aug 15, 2024","The first line is a pretty big issue and has been for years now. 

Last year we did get excellent outscoring from the middle 6 but I question how likely it is to continue. 

Let's look at the Lowry line: They have bested their matchups and actual goal differentials in 2 of the last 4 years. Given that very up and down performance, I'm not as confident they can continue to prop up a top line that hemerages metrics and goals. I would expect some regression and them to be closer to break even in terms of actual goals.

Cole and Ehlers are the two big metric and goal differential players on the team and I think we lose something playing the two on the same line. One of the two needs to be up with Scheifele imo. Both have shown they can elevate him to positive metric and goal differentials. Cole has also shown he can elevate KC to positive results. 

If this team wants to have similar success they are likely going to have to try to create three outscoring lines. I don't think we can count on our middle 6 destroying the opposition by enough again to prop up a crappy top line."
"voyageur","Aug 15, 2024","Only in Winnipeg could your top line center finish +19, highest of all centers, and be considered a crappy line."
"surixon","Aug 15, 2024","I guess my point is the org has wasted a lot of assets on mediocre options to patch the hole. Do I think Copp and Roslovic are legit 2C's on a contender, no I don't. But outside of Dubois we have been wasting assets on vets that didn't meet that criteria either. We would have gained more as an org keeping those assets and going with in house options that weren't any worse then the vets we brought in. That's where I'm guestioning this orgs ability to properly assess center talent and to develop it. Yeah Copp wouldn't have been my first choice but he would have been miles better the Eakins for crying out loud and likely comparable to 35 plus year old Stastny."
"","Aug 15, 2024","I think it is interesting to consider Jets if they had Lundell and Ceulemans instead of Perfetti and Lucius. I think those would have been the most likely picks if Jets had been drafting for position.

An argument could be made at this point that we would be better off. But would that hold true in another couple of years? Not if Lucius recovers from his injury bug and Ceulemans busts or tops out at 3rd pair. If I was betting real money though, I would bet on Lucius busting and Ceulemans becoming a 2nd pair RHD as more likely. Still too soon to judge with any certainty. Could go either way."
"surixon","Aug 15, 2024","I'm talking about the KC - Scheifele combo which was even in terms of goal differential, but got crushed with a 44 XGF%. That plus 19 as you aptly pointed out came with Ehlers on his line, hence my point that one of him or Cole should be replacing Connor there."
"voyageur","Aug 15, 2024","Interesting. I know Scheif and KC had a brutal stretch where they were - alot. That was after the Monahan trade. Obviously judging by the difference in +/- between Vilardi and Connor, there was a period when Vilardi was pulling that line in the right direction. I guess that was with Ehlers, and Connor out of the lineup. But if my eyesight still works KC and Perfetti are a good winger combination?"
"surixon","Aug 15, 2024","Yeah the last two years here are the results:

KC and Mark -4 goal differential with a 46.58 XGF%

Perfetti and Mark +11 goal differential with a 51.66 XGF

Fly and Mark + 15 goal differential with a 53.16 XGF.

I mean clearly two of the combos are light years more impactful then the go to combo. 

For the record Cole with KC the last two years is a +2 goal differential and a 64 XGF%

To me it's a clear win win swapping Nik for KC as both duos are excellent."
"Buffdog","Aug 15, 2024","What is Ehlers goal differential and xGF% away from Schief those years?"
"surixon","Aug 15, 2024","+20 and 55 XGF%"
"Buffdog","Aug 15, 2024","So I'll say it for the 1000th time...

I think  that Ehlers does well enough away from Schief that the ""top two"" lines are better balanced the way they are

In other words, putting Ehlers on a line with Schief makes that line better, but makes the ""second"" line ""more worse"" lol"
"surixon","Aug 15, 2024","Except last year the second line of Perfetti, Name and Iafallo crushed it better then when Ehlers was on it while Fly was on the top line. So we actually had both of our top two lines perform better. 

Perfetti showed he could drive a good second line last year. There is no reason to purposefully stack the deck against the first line because you feel you need to prop the second."
"KingBogo","Aug 15, 2024","Let’s not forget that Perfetti spent the last chunk of the season bouncing between the 4th line and the PB. I think Arniel will give him more rope than Bones but I don’t think they will be expecting him to drive one of the top 6 lines. Arniel talked of liking him with Ehlers."
"surixon","Aug 15, 2024","Sure. But I expect more consistency from him and he showed he could do it over a half a season stretch. 

That gives the team more flexibility knowing they don't need Fly to drive a second scoring line.

I expect politics to result in the KC/Mark/Vilardi line to start the year, but they shouldn't be married to it of the results aren't there as they haven't been for a while now."
"KingBogo","Aug 15, 2024","Actually I’d be very open to a Perfetti Scheifele Ehlers line. I just don’t see Perfetti as being the line driver, but more of a play maker that takes advantage of the open space created by a true line driver like Ehlers."
"DRW204","Aug 15, 2024","Like 80-90% of the + in net goals is from with Ehlers' inclusion on the top line."
"voyageur","Aug 15, 2024","seems like they had a good stretch, whereas 55-81 had a bad one, particularly without Vilardi?"
"DRW204","Aug 15, 2024","You can look at the lines goals either on natural stat trick or money puck."
"DRW204","Aug 17, 2024","i think id rather have Kadri at his current contract than have Monahan, presumably close to what he signed to in CBJ."
"WolfHouse","Aug 17, 2024","Always feel like Wiebe is pretty much a plant for TNSE... like they give him stuff to leak that suits their needs because they know he's a yes man

Like this calms the fan base when we go into next season with a slightly downgraded roster from last season... 'hey we tried...' didn't you read about Kadri and Laine?"
"Buffdog","Aug 17, 2024","I would bet my left testicle that yes, they do know much more than you as a casual fan who watches games and looks at spreadsheets would know"
"voyageur","Aug 17, 2024","It's hard to see the Jets going after Kadri. The leadership group of this team is approaching or in their 30s and it's hard to see the Jets making a big change in the room without their input on it. Seems like the Jets would operate that way

That said Calgary looks like a potential firesale team this year, and if the Jets do have 2C troubles, maybe he is the best option on the market this season. When people talk about moving Scheif to the wing down the road, I think you need a true number 1 centre for that, and that player may not be in the organization. 

There's a balance between trying to remain competitive and aging a team out to being a bust, with long term contracts. If you replaced the contract value of Iafallo, Appleton, Namestnikov with cheaper players, would you get better value in Naz salary Cap wise?"
"surixon","Aug 17, 2024","Can't see Kadri waiving to come here even if we are interested."
"surixon","Aug 17, 2024","He's also a couple months away from 34 and has another 5 years left on his deal. Can't see the team being remotely interested in that contract."
"voyageur","Aug 17, 2024","It's only 4 years left, but I agree with you by and large. That seems like a helluva a contract to pick up...I think Rasmus Andersson on the other hand, if Pionk struggles this year, that's one to look at. 

It's so hard to gauge the Jets this year though...I think if they want to re-sign Adam Lowry, they have to be competitive, with his, Ehlers and KC's future in the balance. The youth movement has to show they can help the team win. I think that's the pressure Chevy faces, with roster management."
"","Aug 17, 2024","Of course they know much more than I do. But question remains. Is it anything that invalidates what I, and everyone else, knows?"
"","Aug 17, 2024","Nope, 5.

Flames would need to retain some. The last 2 years could be bought out.

Why would you say  Pionk struggles""? Is there really any doubt that he will?"
"DRW204","Aug 18, 2024","kadri does have a full nmc so he ultimately decides where/if he wants to go. if he was willing to waive here - unlikely - it does turn into in a m-ntc in 2 years so could move out of him if really required. he did nix a trade from TOR to CGY originally, so never know about waiving or not 

he's been just as productive as scheifele the last 3 years, & has no where near the supporting cast scheifele does. not to mention solidifies a top-6C spot for the medium-term and adds some bite/edge in a Jets top-6 full of softies, along with actual recent deep POs & Cup experience."
"KingBogo","Aug 18, 2024","Well 3 years ago he did play with the Avs so I would say yeah he did have somewhere close to the same supporting cast  His 2 years since in Calgary Kadri's top 5 on 5 minutes have been with Weegar 785, Andersson 776 and Huberdeau at 713. Not sure overall that is much different than the quality of Schiefele's line mates."
"","Aug 18, 2024","I used to maintain that I would  want Kadri. Dirty player. But I don't mind a pest who stays just on the right side of the line.

At this stage of the game, I would welcome pesty Kadri at least until he falls off that cliff.
That could be at any time but if he could be reasonably good for 2-3 years, I'd be happy with him. The last 2 years of his contract could be bought out if necessary.

If he would waive I would give up McGroarty for him. I'd like to see a little retention from Flames."
"KingBogo","Aug 18, 2024","They would have to take back a contract and retention to even come close to working out. I'm not opposed to Kadri, but we have $5.8 M in cap space with Perfetti unsigned. Even a 2 year bridge for Perfetti leave us with something around $2 M cap space available."
"DRW204","Aug 18, 2024","I'll concede Colorado. But the flames is nothing great. A mix of Connor, ehlers, Morrissey, Vilardi then consider Helle > the flames.

These were his most used line combos last year



U taking that or equal to the Jets top 6 wings, really."
"","Aug 18, 2024","Yes, we would need to make some space."
"KingBogo","Aug 18, 2024","You said the last 3 years, not last season. I responded to what you posted."
"DRW204","Aug 18, 2024","His 2 most productive years came in the past 3 years. I'd have to check what his pt finishes were since scoring is up, but iirc he was around top 40 on overall pts and top 30 in 5v5 production (on mobile otherwise I'd check).

7m is def a big ticket though. However if they were in the running with Monahan at 5.5m id consider an extra 1.5m for a superior player who also can add intangibles and has the option to get out of.


Yeah and I'd take the jets crew over the flames. You posted huberdeau as if he's been impressive in Calgary. Don't think anyone is taking him over Connor. Not even close to the same tier anymore. 

His 22-23 linemates mix may be even worse."
"","Aug 18, 2024","I'm not against the Kadri trade idea, depending his cost of course, which should be reflective IMO that the last x years of his deal will not be good. I'm ok to it bc as virtually all last contracts around the NHL they never end well and I doubt Helle & Mark's will end well. So the Jets window is over the next 4-5-6 years max, so Kadri deal would just be one more bad deal at the end of our window. Bad deals can have value in trade depending how their arranged, some teams always need to hit the floor and want to pay as little real cash as possible. Not sure how Kadri deal was setup or not. Kadri is a legit 2c and we need one."
"WolfHouse","Aug 18, 2024","Thank God we have Johnson in the lineup"
"","Aug 18, 2024","On one hand I like Kadri's determination, kinda dirty, pain in the ass to play against style. 

Honestly pretty similar to Dubois, just gets it done with heart and some skill as oppose to rare tools.

That contract is a liability though.

Tough to work around that without sending something we don't want back.

That and he probably isn't waiving to come here. That's my stance unless I hear otherwise lol"
"","Aug 18, 2024","If we can turn it into a bigger trade and score Andersson I think it would really increase our cup odds. Hopefully McGroarty and some firsts would get it done

The question is how long does he still have 2C capabilites for. If it's only for another 2 years then his contract could prematurely close the window.

I think age and term left are major risks here. Frankly they aren't the risks I'd be interested in taking."

"voyageur","Aug 19, 2024","There are a lot of people who hope he does struggle...however a good season from Samberg too might make Pionk a candidate for being re-signed, and I can already read the reaction that would cause. 

I wonder if Laine going to Montreal puts Ehlers on their radar. 

Is the Jets target to sign 40% of their impending UFAs like last year?

Losing all of Ehlers, Pionk, Appleton, 
Namestnikov and Iafallo without significant adds would put the team a step behind...unless there is Miracle Grow in our prospect pool."
"","Aug 20, 2024","I think those people, myself included, expect him to struggle. If being paired with Samberg makes him better, it can only be so much. If that is enough to get Chevy to extend him it should be the last straw for Chevy. SMH

Reuniting Batman and Robin might have some value. Can't see what they would give up for Ehlers though.

Losing 5 UFAs might sound bad but Ehlers is the only one there that really matters. The rest are depth players, fairly easily replaced."
"voyageur","Aug 20, 2024","The Jets don't easily replace anyone. It's nice to think that are prospects are golden, and that vets can be replaced seamlessly. But that isn't usually how it works...Very rarely will you find a successful rookie laden team. It's a process to develop into a pro and then learn the pro game, process it at a higher speed. Usually has highs and lows. Think of Ehlers first season where he looked great and then went into a 30 game scoring drought."
"lanky","Aug 21, 2024","Ehlers was 19 y.o. to start that season and had only 11 games of pro experience in the Swiss league.
Chibrikov, for example, is now 21 and has 186 games under his belt, across the VHL, KHL, AHL and NHL. He's ready to contribute.
The downside to integrating him now instead of later is that he's a lightweight LW and our roster is already full of those."

"voyageur","Aug 21, 2024","Bad is a relative term. Compare him to Beaulieu for instance. If he was bad he wouldn't have played all those years behind Adam Lowry's line, d-zone starts...he'd be sheltered like Heinola and Stanley were. Our coaches aren't idiots they played in the Show they can obviously judge good and bad players. He's inconsistent, I'll give you that. 

What I wonder this year is if Arniel favours vets over young players. Does AJF get the first callup if a player goes down? Because he knows the systems/head coach? That's what I am waiting to see if things are different."
"voyageur","Aug 21, 2024","I can't say the Jets did anything wrong with the way they developed players last year. All the AHL/pro rookies got an entire year to develop, find their roles. It was a talent poor team that Ehlers graduated into. I think Lambert, Chibrikov, Ford and Lucius all are competing while growing as teammates. I hope every one of them gets a chance at some point during the season to make an impression. The best should rise, and then the next tier is still in position to compete for spots next year.

Chibrikov for me isn't a top 6 player, and with the Jets top 6 that doesn't kill penalties, unless KC gets in there, and with Nino being a PP guy, maybe he needs a player like Namestnikov to hold down a top 6 position and PK so that he can get into the lineup. But who can predict injuries? I do have to say that the line of Nino-Gus-Chibrikov showed some spark in the one chance they got last year, and with a firebug player, in the NHL, that seems like a good fit, two guys who can work the boards and win battles in the neutral and d-zone. 

With Lambert I wonder if there is any imperative this season, after a strong offensive output last season on the farm, to give him more PK reps, which strengthens his potential to be the future 2C."
"","Aug 22, 2024","I don't think he has been all that inconsistent. He has been pretty consistently bad.

Coaches playing him is not much of an endorsement if they don't see a better option. Like you said, it is relative. Who else could the coaches have played at 2RD? Schmidt? Lundmark? Kovacevic?

Yes, use of young players will be a tell."

But the real way a team like the Jets works, that doesn't have any allure for a lot of players, is the family model.

Monahan joined the Jets because Scheif knew him from past hockey experiences, and they hoped that he would spark the team's PP. Toffoli and Monahan, Ottawa 67s. 

Schmidt joined the team because Stastny knew him from Vegas, and recommended him, and even convinced him to waive his NTC to come here, when Chevy needed d-men badly. Stastny only waived his NTC to come here because of past experiences with Wheeler.

Out of the package of Valardi, Kupari and Iafallo in the Dubois trade, I think Iafallo is the only one who knew anyone on this team coming in, as a former teammate of Pionk's and Samberg at UMD.

Then you have to account for players wives, and the role they have...This is a team that by and large is not living the single party life, in a city where they aren't recognized. It's built like a family team.

Occasionally you look outside the circle from someone to bring in, like Nino, when it's a move that helps your hockey team.

Prospects who grow through development camps and the process can become friends off the ice like Nikkanen and Torgersson, Julien and Levis, Ehlers and Laine, or the foundation of the team, Scheif and Morrissey...

Mc Groarty seemed like he would have grown with Lucius through the process, but you win some you lose some. At least it wasn't a distraction like Kane, or Trouba holding out, with a spot already on the team. 

Jets have more than enough Cap space to sign Perfetti, call up prospects with the slightest of injuries, if they don't like a player's game. And make moves during the season when more players become available.

The flip side is this could be a firesale year, with the Cap floor reachable, if things go wrong."

Ultimately depends on what is considered  AAV from Perfetti's POV."

"KingBogo","Aug 29, 2024","The biggest question for me going into the 24-25 season is where is Lambert in his development. Sending him down to junior late in the 22-23 season now seems to be a stroke of genius by Chevy. By playing with peers he got to feel offense again and then that carried into the 23-24 season with the Moose where he was their top forward. My question is, is his development arc now pointing straight up where he can jump into the NHL and be an effective middle 6 center? Because if he can that changes a lot of the discussion of this team's potential."
"surixon","Aug 29, 2024","They probably should give him a shot as it would give the team more information heading into next offseason when they are going to have to make a large number of roster decisions with all the expiring contracts we have.

Also I'm sick with going with the safe low upside choice. Take a risk for once."
"KingBogo","Aug 29, 2024","Agreed. Lambert may turn out to be one of Chevy's biggest good fortune picks. Getting Rangers 1st round pick in the draft with them making the conference finals and then having a player once considered a likely top 5 pick drop down to 30, where you got him with that pick. For me give the kid an NHL job and lets see what he does with the opportunity. He has followed the organization's prospect plan of a year in the AHL so give him a shot."
"","Aug 29, 2024","I think they'll work him in over the season - 
Keeping in mind, the Jets are a team on a mission to make the PO's - that's the goal more so than launching careers.
Steady as she goes is Chevy's motto - and I don't expect that to change - but's it's fun to dream in the offseason.

What will be more interesting to me is how Perfetti is handled and how much rope he'll get.
Can he hold down a top 6 spot if he slips? If he does, this is a possible landing spot for Lambert - and there's also the possibility of an injury.
And a line of Ehlers / Names / Lambert would be interesting.
Not advocating for this - but it's worth mentions (IMO) with Lambert as an option."

"KingBogo","Aug 29, 2024","For me there are 2 roster positions being held down by Axel and Kupari that have no barring on our future. I am far from a prospect hawk, but this is the time to introduce your top prospect that has done everything the organization has asked for 2 years with a smile on his face and never a word of complaint. You give him opportunity and let him learn on the job. It is not like he is a raw prospect that hasn't been around professional leagues. IMO the Jets need to start getting a little more aggressive on this front if they hope to add enough talent to support the older core for any type of contention window."

"","Aug 29, 2024","There's no reason they can't land him on the 4th line - and that's likely his route in.
But to get the most from this player, they can't leave him there too long - that's more of what I was referring to (should have expanded a bit on that).

I'd suggest something similar to how KC was handled."
"KingBogo","Aug 29, 2024","There is nothing there. Like I posted the KHL starts up the 1st week of September and he just wrapped up camp with his KHL team. There is no news since a casual comment 2+ months ago. And talking to his agent is likely more to the effect of when he is able to sign a contract in the NHL."
"","Aug 29, 2024","Looks like he is staying there another year."
"KingBogo","Aug 29, 2024","KC is a great example as both Lambert and KC were born in December so our old for their draft year. At the same age in his D +3 season Connor played 76 NHL games with 31 G 26 A 57 P."
"KingBogo","Aug 29, 2024","I looked at that prior to responding to you and even at the beginning of July the report said it is likely he would be back in the KHL this year. Now it is late August and he just went through training camp with his KHL team and his regular season starts in a couple of days. Maybe next season but no chance this season."
"surixon","Aug 29, 2024","My guess is he never comes over."
"Buffdog","Aug 29, 2024","It seemed like Lambert really started developing when he took a step back. Maybe rushing him isn't in his best interest 

That said, it can't hurt to give him a look at the start of the season and if it looks like he isn't thriving, send him back to the Moose and let him dominate there and run Names as 2C"
"voyageur","Aug 29, 2024","I think these kids have to win a job, whether it be Lambert, Chibrikov or Ford...show you can do the job better than the person you are competing with.

"","Aug 29, 2024","Yes, they need to play well - that goes without saying.
But there is hope in the air that a guy like Lambert can jump in fairly quick and progress just as quickly.
Personally, I'm looking for something new and shiny to show up and make it tough for the Jets to ignore - not just a depth pce
Probably wishful thinking more than anything - but we need an injection.


might as well . . ."
"Bob E","Aug 30, 2024","The top line is slower no doubt, but I was thinking of sheltering both Lambert and Perfetti with a couple of vets on their lines. 

I do think they will stick with C-S-V as their #1 line, and have Ehlers and Perfetti on the 2nd line. Names is likely the 2C to start the season, but I'm hopeful they try Lambert there, and if they do, I would think they shelter him with a couple of vets. 

You could move Nino up, to add some size for Lambert too, but I don't see them moving Ehlers down to allow that."

"Weezeric","Aug 30, 2024","Perfetti-Namestnikov-Ehlers

Switch centres half way through the year."
"KingBogo","Aug 30, 2024","I don't know if it is rushing him? D+3 is not really a rush if the player excelled in the AHL in his D+2 season. Sure if he was coming out of junior you want more time, but Lambert was the best forward on our AHL team and was a league all star. Does he really need more grooming at that level? I'll add he is old for his draft class being born in December so in many respects he is closer in age to the draft prior to his."
"voyageur","Aug 30, 2024","There was a comparison to him and Roslovic and I think that's a good one. Both played their first full season in the A at D+2. Roslovic split his time D+3 between Moose, as a C on a line with Petan and Appleton, and the Jets at RW with Little and Perreault mostly, including 10 playoff games.

Getting to the NHL as a winger has fast tracked a few players, most recently Perfetti.

If the Jets are serious about making Lambert a 2C who competes against elite centres in the league, I think there are all kinds of factors to consider: physical maturity first, conditioning, roles (do you want him to work on faceoffs, PK, all the things a good 2C should do? Two way game), and I suppose there is the confidence thing too. You want your young players to succeed...putting them in situations where they may not be able to can adversely affect a player's development. I feel like he's potentially ready for the NHL but I am not sure he's ready to be an NHL 2C. The one thing to consider though is he may not get the mentorship at the NHL level from the same group of players that he could this year...

Really can't say how the organization sees him going into this year, but the last time the Jets had a centre on the team in their d+3 was Andrew Copp, who was already in his first college year when drafted, with a July birthday that separated him by one draft year from Trouba. And that was as a 4C mostly."
"bumblebeeman","Aug 31, 2024","I think the way to develop him into a 2C is to give him a try as the 3C and let him grow. Lowry's line always takes the tough matchups for now, let Lambert play softer matchips with o-zone starts and with great wingers and see if he can take advantage, and at least not be a liability.

So something like:

Connor - Scheif - Ehlers/Vilardi
Nino - Lowry - Appleton
Perfetti - Lambert - Ehlers/Vilardi"
"voyageur","Aug 31, 2024","I think it would be pretty easy for the Jets to roll 4 lines where 2-4 are all in the same ice time range.

KC-Scheif-Valardi
Nino-Lambert-Ehlers
Perfetti-Namestnikov-Iafallo
Barron-Lowry-Appleton

I think that balances out good. But a coach has to look at special teams too and with Monahan gone, unless Barron becomes the 2C on the PK and improves on faceoffs there is a real void in that C position, so I feel like one of Gus or Kupari have a role to win, and Gus is good on the draw and the PK so he probably slides in there somewhere. 

That's where I think the extra development time could help Lambert, but if he's hungry enough, I think this could be the year...maybe he starts on the Moose, and just works his way into the lineup where he can't be taken out of it..."

"Bob E","Yesterday at 5:58 PM","Makes a 2nd line very fast, that another team has to account for. Which d pairing and line do they try to match up against. If all three play fast, harder for other team to win the match up. 

Improving team speed will also come with Salomonsson replacing Pionk in the lineup. And a Freij over Stanley (even Heinola) eventually. Even having Yager in over McGroarty will improve our team speed in future. Want to be a quicker team, draft faster skaters."
"DRW204","Yesterday at 6:01 PM","None that solves your first line lack of speed. 

And none of those prospects are playing a meaningful amount of nhl in 2024-2025 which is this thread's topic."
"Bob E","Yesterday at 7:41 PM","Too early to say a young player like Salomonsson isn’t going to play a meaningful amount in NHL until camp ends and season begins imo. Freij, absolutely, he’s not even coming over and is years away. 

Any line that has Perfetti, won’t be a burner line. But with Scheifele it won’t be pedestrian either. If you want to keep CSV together, then a Perfetti-Lambert-Ehlers line (or with Names) would be faster than a 2nd line with Toffoli and Monahan. You’re sacrificing size for speed."
"KingBogo","Yesterday at 9:14 PM","There is a lot of debate on when to insert young players into the lineup, and I am far from a prospect hawk, but IMO Chevy needs to find a balance here. I'll argue over and over again for the importance of development, but IMO Chevy slow plays the introduction of young players to too great of an extent. I'll take Lambert as an example. He is now going into his D+3 season after a breakout AHL season. This is the same season Schiefele and Connor became regulars. Ehlers and Perfetti a year earlier. Just my opinion, but if you have a prospect ready you need to let him jump to the next level. Sure there will be a few growing pains, but the rewards for exceed the risks IMO."
"surixon","Yesterday at 9:45 PM","I am still wondering what is going to happen with Ehlers. Do we get another double long term signing announcement with him and Cole over the next few days to a week or does he start the season unsigned?

The reason why I think this is important is if he's unsigned I see them dealing him mid season and then inserting Brad in his spot.

If he's inked long term then it's once again fourth line minutes for a prospect and the team doesn't like doing that."
"Whileee","Yesterday at 10:39 PM","I tend to agree. If Lambert shows he's ready then slot him onto RW in the top 9 and move Appleton or Iafallo. With the responsible Lowry and Namestnikov at 2/3 C the Jets can afford to put some offensive sparkle in their middle 6."
"Buffdog","Today at 12:02 AM","To be fair, Chevy has talked about adding youth to the line ups in the past only to have the coach at the time not do so

Going into 2016-17, I know for a fact that Maurice was given an order to play the kids. After that, who knows. Coaches, when given the autonomy, tend to ice the line ups that they think will give them the vest chance to win

TL/DR, I don't think that this is a Chevy issue"
"KingBogo","Today at 5:37 AM","Personally I think we sign Ehlers late in camp similarly to Helle and Scheifele last season. I think Perfetti signs very soon before camp. Saying that I think it should be easy enough to find places to insert Lambert into the lineup where it is not a pure 4th energy line."
"WolfHouse","Today at 6:48 AM","Shouldn't we wait until camp starts to say we are not giving Lambert etc a shot this year haha?"

"DannyGallivan","Today at 9:39 AM","Puffed wheat… big, but not tough. Last year you had Dillon and Lowry when things got ugly. We lost half that now.

We have size at forward for puck battles and forechecking. On defense we have Stanley (spot duty with the slowest fists in the league, Samberg (not tough), Morrissey (undersized), Pionk (undersized)…

My point is that Dillon left a hole. He brought an element to the team that will be missed."
"Whileee","52 minutes ago","I'm still not sure how much of the ""slow play"" of prospects is Chevy, and how much is on the coaches. I think it's also a function of where the Jets' management and coaches see the team and its contention window. 

Recall that after the 2015 playoffs (Jets swept by Anaheim) the Jets realized that they didn't have enough talent in their core and needed to spend a couple of seasons transitioning to younger and more talented players. Over the next 3 seasons they traded Ladd and transitioned to younger players (Ehlers/Copp, then Morrissey/Hellebuyck, Connor/Laine, etc.). At the time, Chevy and Maurice were clear that they were transitioning to their youth because they realized the core wasn't good enough.

The big question right now is what Chevy and the coaches think about the potential of this roster. Do they think they can take another run in the next couple of seasons with this core, or do they think they need to add some youth and skill to get to the next level? I think they are much more confident in this core / roster than they were after 2015, which might mean that they slow-play Lambert and some of the youth a bit more than they did in the seasons after 2015. 

I think this will be a pivotal season. If they have another really strong regular season, then I think they'll try again to make a run (which might mean rentals or ""own rentals""). If they look like they aren't really competitive, then I could see them making fundamental changes mid-season or at the TDL to accelerate youth and maybe to change the roster structure (i.e. add a top RD and/or 2C). That might mean trading a core player (Ehlers?) or selling at the TDL (Iafallo, Pionk, Appleton, etc.) to get some draft pick capital for off-season restructuring."
"DRW204","26 minutes ago","So who is coming out of the lineup, not injury related, where Salomonssen plays over 50% of the nhl season in 24-25?

Honestly think your lineup ideas are a bit far fetched."
"DRW204","18 minutes ago","The lineup is better far better now than when scheifele or ehlers started playing. The Jets are a win-now team with Helle (and Scheifele, but mostly Helle imo) still playing at a high level, so they'll continue to go for it while they have elite goaltending - the hardest thing to come by in the league.

10 years ago, Ehlers couldn't play in the AHL and pretty sure anyone who watched QMJHL knew he was done there along with a clear spot on the Jets team in 2015. The Jets center depth when Scheifele broke in was Little and a rag-tag group of players, and still took an injury to Little for his ascension to 1c.

Ladd refused to re sign here same with Frolik so there were openings for players. Although it took Perreault to get hurt for Connor to be a regular in 2017. Then add Laine who was a 2OA pick that was going to play right away in 2016.

Compared to today, essentially the entire Jets fwd group to start last year is back. Don't think any of the current prospects at fwds are comparable to Connor, Ehlers or Laine at similar age or prospect status (I'll defer to others here though). IMO next year will be likely the year for Fwd openings with some potential UFAs"
