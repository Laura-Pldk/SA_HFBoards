"Tralfamadore","May 16, 2024","Ottawa seems nowhere close so Vancouver obviously."
"Despote","May 16, 2024","Due to the sheer fact that Canucks are currently two wins away from making the WCF, it's obviously them. Who knows if this was an one-off year or if they will be a succesful team in the future, but I don't see any reason to think Ottawa will be better going forward either.

I mean will anybody be surprised if Ottawa doesn't even make playoffs in the next few years?"
"","May 16, 2024","Ottawa doesn't seem capable of getting past the first few stages of their rebuild and becoming a playoff team. 

I don't think Vancouver is a serious Cup contender either going forward though. They'll probably lose to Edmonton but definitely lose in the WCF if they do make it past the Oilers. I think in the old 1-8 format the Nucks would've lost to the Avs in 5 in the first round. 

So technically Vancouver is closer than Ottawa but I'd put both of their chances at winning pretty low"
"joestevens29","May 16, 2024","Vancouver. Even if they lose this round at least they are at the point where the can identify what tweaks are needed to make the conference finals and or stanley cup finals.

Ottawa is still tinkering with figuring out how to get into the playoffs.

Then through the whole 5 year timeline. While I don't think that the Nucks will win in the next 5 years, I don't really think Ottawa is even making the cup final in 5 years."
"NyQuil","May 16, 2024","How is it not Vancouver?

I'm curious to read why you think this would be a reasonable poll.

Vancouver isn't exactly ancient and they are well-ahead of Ottawa as far as competitiveness is concerned and overall depth at all positions."
"MCR74","May 16, 2024","Are you serious? Close this one before it's too late."
"NyQuil","May 16, 2024","I assume this is one of those “I have a buddy who said something” polls."
"Rowlet","May 17, 2024","Canucks have the two best centers, the best D (arguably in the league), the two best goalies



Canucks would have played LA in 1-8, as they won their division, and even if you ignore that, they would have still played Nashville as they were behind the Jets."
"","May 17, 2024","Lopsided result."
