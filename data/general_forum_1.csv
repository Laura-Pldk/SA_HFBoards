"Brookbank","May 16, 2023","My prediction is that no Canadian team will have won a Stanley cup. This isn't just a salty take. It is just one of those trends that everyone thinks will inevitably break but just doesn't. And won't. 

Columbus will still be unlucky and wont win a draft lottery. And if it does, it will be the weakest draft in modern history.

Tampa Bay will stumble into another surefire #1 OA pick just like Chicago did again.

The Oilers still won't have a true #1 goaltender.

Seattle and Vegas will always be stronger than anyone expects. And will make the playoffs more often than not.

The Canucks will make the playoffs at some point and go on a run and come up short. Riot will ensue. Just as it did in 1994 and 2011.

Anyway do you have any predictions 5 years out ?"
"aryanoboi","May 16, 2023","Toronto wins the next 5 Stanley cups. Matthews, on Arizona, is in disgust watching golden boy Marner score 56 goals and 181 points the first year after he was traded, and watching matt murray win 3 conn smythes. So much salt reigns from Gary Bettman's tears a new mining industry is set up. Coach Darryl Sutter is so impressed with the team his first year, he moves his ranch to the middle of downtown Toronto and sets up a new Maple Leafs training camp at his farm to help train his players in the offseason. Rumour has it that the hard work, effort, and determination that they learned at the farm is what led them to those 5 Stanley cups, and the eternal dynasty of the Toronto Maple Leafs."
"","May 16, 2023","Montreal will win a Cup by 2028.

Washington, Pittsburgh, Boston and Tampa will head toward a rebuild.

Oilers will stubbornly hold onto Draisaitl and McDavid and never be able to surround them correctly.

Third season: Preds win the division title in a horse race. They hang a banner. Novak scores 45 goals.

"Mackiaveli","May 17, 2023","Montreal, Ottawa, Buffalo and New Jersey (3/4 of them) will be powerhouse teams in the East.

Philadelphia will be a dark-horse defensive style team that plays tough hockey with a few talented finishers who don't mind chipping in the extra effort - their captain will be Sanheim.

Vegas or Seattle will have won a Stanley Cup before the Toronto Maple Leafs.

Toronto will still be a competitive team season after season but will never break the hump - the furthest their core sees is an Eastern Conference Final where they lose in Game 6 to the New Jersey Devils.

Detroit consistently underperforms despite seemingly having all the right pieces - there is starting to be concern about Yzerman's plan - they have made the playoffs a few times but they haven't made a deep run (or they win the cup in 2028)

Crosby and Malkin go on one more deep run.

Salt Lake and Houston get teams."
"Oneiro","May 17, 2023","Just spitballing, don't take it personally:

NJ, CAR, BUF and OTT perpetual playoff teams in the East. OTT becomes a cap team.

TOR fans experience more existential pain as nothing is left from the big 4 era except for a few late 1sts and promising B-tier prospects. Dubas leaves. Books get written about this era.

NJ wins multiple cups. BUF wins one.

FLA is often a playoff team but their chance is never as good as it is now as a lot of guys leave in UFA and Zito wisely does not overpay, opting for a retool. But the drafting can't replenish them. Barkov is never the same player as his ""most underrated"" phase.

By '28, MTL becomes the new Minnesota Wild - your annual un-threatening playoff team. Slafkovsky is a middle 6 caliber guy.

On that note, MIN stays mediocre and Kaprizov is traded. Boldy becomes C. Rossi, Ohgren, etc. are never that good, much like the previous MIN young core. But Wallstedt becomes the new Shesterkin/Price, dragging a subpar group to the playoffs. And Boldy stays on trajectory.

DAL is the clear best in the west. They get a cup.

COL stays good but no longer great - they make a big deadline acquisition for a star, get some luck and win one more before becoming the new WAS.

NYR can't get past the hump and are stuck in mushy middle, cap hell. Lafreniere, Lindgren and eventually Shesterkin are traded as they try to accumulate picks and refuse to go to 10M+ for Shesterkin. Another one of their long term forwards agrees to a trade, the others veto. 

CHI is still lottery bad two years into Bedard's first extension. 

CBJ is still bad but they get a first overall for their troubles. At the '26 deadline, they trade Laine at 50% for a late 1st that ends up being a key piece.

LA becomes the new Boston - great regular season team that can't put it together in the post-season. Clarke ends up being as good as predicted.

McDavid and Draisaitl both walk cup-less and the cycle begins anew in EDM. The summer before McD's last year is drama-filled and annoying for all of us.

VAN is status quo and Pettersson demands a trade. Hughes gets traded at the '27 deadline for two 1sts. Signs in NJ as a UFA right when Hamilton's contract expires as the joke becomes real. VAN starts the rebuild again.

ANA and DET make the playoffs once each but are easy outs. Kasper ends up being even better than people expect, Fantilli worse. 

PIT is a bubble team, making it some years but mostly missing. Guentzel walks. Letang retires early. They try to make a UFA splash and it backfires.

SJ starts turning the corner faster than expected. Vlasic gets one last, albeit meaningless playoff run. Karlsson is traded at next year's deadline, for a 1st, two major cap dumps and a top prospect. It's not the haul that SJ wants but one they'll accept.

STL and BOS fade as ""culture"" overtakes reality with management. Both GMs get fired/""resign"" and mini-Dubas replacements come in and overhaul both organizations, top to bottom. By '28, they're both lottery teams. Buchnevich waives for a contender. Hall gets traded 50% retained at the deadline for one last hurrah before his body gives out.

CGY owners can't see the light. They run it back, extend the wrong guys and f*** up what should've been one of the quickest rebuilds ever. 

WPG have trouble dealing this summer because of the tight cap, but by next summer, sell as they should, bringing back a haul. They become a case study vs. the Flames as far as rebuilds done right.

TB wins the lottery and gets a first overall, which annoys everybody. They are bad and Cooper leaves but their future ends up looking better than most former contenders.

NYI keeps running it back, but Lou dies on the job and another experienced league mainstay comes in to replace him. They start the long, slow painful rebuild. Barzal and Dobson get traded in '25 as the cap increases make it more viable.

NSH finally commits to a rebuild after another year of forcing it with this core. Saros is moved. Josi and Forsberg are in the same situation that Doughty-Kopitar are in now.

PHI stays a joke, the drafting stays bad, team gets sold.

WAS becomes a laughing stock, and Ovy barely beats out Gretzky's record before injuries finally settle in and he leaves for a big KHL paycheck, Kovy-style.

VGK fades just in time to get a top 5 pick. SEA is still a playoff team.

The Coyotes become yet another Texan team with a lame name. The jerseys are very boring, much like the city of Houston."

-A team will take a chance on a outside the box concept for a General Manager, it will be wildly successful. Other teams will start to take note, with mixed results.

-The NHL will be the puppet master of the Arizona Coyotes as a last ditch multi-year effort. They will start to install some of their top people into roles for the team (Marketing and Analytics). The idea will be to make the team successful both on the ice and off. They will hope the hype train is enough to entice one of the major cities in Arizona to take the bait on a Arena deal. Will it work? Cloudy is the future to quote Yoda (kind of).

-Detroit will NOT be as successful as every one thinks Yzerman should be. They will make the playoffs, but not generate as much success.

-Nashville Predators will go through a major rebrand in the 2026-2027 season, they will adopt a new color scheme and logo. Mixed feelings will be had by the long time faithful, the younger fans and fans outside the team will be pleasantly shocked.

-Outdoor game in a neutral location, the NHL will be looking for Destination site games to try and drum up excitement for the Outdoor games. These will be really hyped up as ""Festivals for all hockey fans"" to enjoy.
