PRESEASON BROADCAST!!!!

GET f***ED BALLY!!!"
"starsfan86","Yesterday at 7:13 PM","So far so good on the broadcast"
"account deactivated","Yesterday at 7:14 PM","Yeah, I was concerned about being able to run the video in the Edge browser on my Xbox (since they don't have the SamsungTV app out yet), but it's been running flawlessly. Hopefully a good sign."
"BG44","Yesterday at 7:20 PM","For you out of market folks."
"account deactivated","Yesterday at 7:30 PM","I gotta say, Bichsel is making Nils look damn good."
"Kcb12345","Yesterday at 7:32 PM","Pretty solid start. It's just good to be back man"
"ElGuapo","Yesterday at 7:49 PM","So nice to even be able to watch this. Production quality seems good."
"starsfan86","Yesterday at 7:51 PM","Petrovic still a dipshit"
"Kcb12345","Yesterday at 7:53 PM","Bichsel has had a strong period. Fun to watch"
"SJSharksfan39","Yesterday at 8:17 PM","Just curious what the new Stars Telecast would be like and does it seem like everything is zoomed in? That is a pretty big scorebug (Glad it's on top rather than the Bally way) and the Victory+ thing is large."
"Kcb12345","Yesterday at 8:19 PM","Fantastic defense by Bichsel on that 2 on 1"
"starsfan86","Yesterday at 8:23 PM","Can’t buy a goal"
"ElGuapo","Yesterday at 8:24 PM","No doesn't look zoomed in. I do wish the bug and V+ logo were scaled down by a out 1/3.No other complaints."
"Kcb12345","Yesterday at 8:24 PM",""
"SJSharksfan39","Yesterday at 8:26 PM","It looks a lot cleaner than Ballys ever did. I think if they shrunk everything like you said, it would look even better. I even like the time on ice bar at the bottom. Better than showing other scores at least."
"SJSharksfan39","Yesterday at 8:32 PM","Other than who is on the ice, this doesn't feel like a preseason game. There's a lot of physicality for being the first preseason game of the season. It's like the two teams minor leagues/rookie squads decided they just don't like each other."
"Henderson33","Yesterday at 8:33 PM","Can't believe Alex Petrovic actually played in playoff games for us."
"starsfan86","Yesterday at 8:35 PM","Blumel still a dumb hockey player"
"Cowboyluck","Yesterday at 8:40 PM","They look pretty good though"
"starsfan86","Yesterday at 8:45 PM","Only one preseason game, but Blackwell playing like he wants to be the healthy scratch.

I’m liking Capionancagshdhs"
"Kcb12345","Yesterday at 8:48 PM","Capobianco scores 1-0 Stars"
"starsfan86","Yesterday at 8:58 PM","Stankoven has 9 shots after 2 periods lol. He deserves a goal"
"BG44","Yesterday at 9:01 PM","Bourque looked like he took a big hit at the end of that period. Hope he's OK."
"Troy McClure","Yesterday at 9:20 PM","Are you watching on a TV or other device?"
"Kcb12345","Yesterday at 9:25 PM","Blackwell scores from distance. Bichsel will get an assist"
"starsfan86","Yesterday at 9:26 PM","Shouldn’t have gone it but we’ll take it. Bichsel looks solid tonight"
"jballa95","Yesterday at 9:28 PM","Looks like a completely different player compared to his Traverse City play"
"Troy McClure","Yesterday at 9:38 PM","Bichsel's size is crazy when you see him skating with everyone else. There are a number of tall NHLers, but he's thick like how Shaq was compared to other NBA big men."
"Kcb12345","Yesterday at 9:46 PM","Stars win 2-1"
"Troy McClure","Yesterday at 9:48 PM","After what I saw, I think I'd start the Cup parade at the Cotton Bowl this time."
"account deactivated","Yesterday at 9:48 PM","Yeah, I noticed he's not a lanky dude who when you see him on his own looks like he'd be tall like Oleksiak. He's like proportional in the way that if someone shows you a picture of him where you can't gauge his size based on things around him, he'd look like he could literally be any height."
"Troy McClure","Yesterday at 9:51 PM","And I've watched one of his international games where he was also the biggest guy, but I wasn't sure what to make of it because being big in a U20 tournament isn't the same as being big in the NHL."
"SJSharksfan39","Yesterday at 10:00 PM","I'm not watching anymore, but it was on ESPN+"
"FirstRowUpperDeck","Yesterday at 10:03 PM","Hearing here that Liam wouldn't be ready for the NHL this year disappointed me. His performance tonight didn't.

Lundquist's turnover leading to a goal against probably seals his fate here, even if he did make several nice plays earlier.

App worked perfectly for me on both my phone and TV."
"Linkens Mastery","Yesterday at 10:05 PM","Your guys new streaming platform is nice. Very smooth from what I watched tonight."
"Kcb12345","Yesterday at 10:08 PM","App worked great on my TV. Super buggy on my PC but maybe that's cause I was using an ultrawide monitor idk. 

Broadcast picture size didn't scale to the size of the screen properly
Game kept freezing after a while
Game glitched out a couple of times (sometimes rewinded itself, other times paused itself)
After a few seconds on the screen, if I didn't push full screen immediately it would disappear entirely and never reappeared unless I refreshed"
"Troy McClure","Yesterday at 10:29 PM","That's actually great feedback to send to them. 

It worked great on my Amazon Fire stick. Smoother than the Bally's app every did."
"Troy McClure","Yesterday at 10:32 PM","I think the thing with Bichsel is Nill did the same thing he did to Stankoven/Bourque last season where he signed so many NHL bodies that there isn't even a roster spot available to win out of camp. Because of signings made in July, Bichsel is going back to the AHL."
"starsfan86","Yesterday at 10:44 PM","Jim Depth Nill"
"Troy McClure","Yesterday at 10:50 PM","Last season was pretty crazy. The Stars had no real injury problems with forwards until February or so. I don't know how often a team goes so long never having more than one forward unable to play."
"piqued","Yesterday at 11:30 PM","Calm down Laura"
