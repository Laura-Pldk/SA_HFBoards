"Jojalu","Saturday at 8:41 AM","I had already forgotten Stamkos left TB.

Looks like it will be the same 4 battling it out like every year."
"ACC1224","Saturday at 8:46 AM","I think if Berube can get them to focus a little better, throw away less winnable games, they could win the division."
"BobClarkesfrontteeth","Saturday at 12:14 PM","I think one of Tampa or Boston slips enough to let Buffalo to at least challenge for the last playoff spot in the Atlantic. With Swayman holding out, Lindholm bumping down all the centers without be a number 1C or even a top tier 2C and I am not sure how much Zardov helps as a top 4 dman I can see a big drop coming for Boston."
"Puckstuff","Saturday at 12:24 PM","When was the last time they won the division?

I’m pretty sure they haven’t won the division in the Matthews era which is sort of surprising."
"MilkofthePoppy","Saturday at 12:24 PM","If Boston gets Swayman signed I don't think anybody overtakes them. With the additions of Lindholm and Zadarov I believe they return to the top of the Atlantic. I predict the Leafs finish third behind the Bruins and Panthers, though I hope the Cats suffer from a Stanley Cup hangover. I think the Lightening will demonstrate a slight decline this season."
"LeafalCrusader","Saturday at 12:27 PM","They won the Canadian division then proceeded to choke in their usual spectacular fashion in the playoffs."
"HockeyVirus","Saturday at 1:02 PM","Very easily. What all the contending teams seem to have in common is the ability to seemingly win every game. I think we need to get that level of dominating other teams night in and out and if we find it we can easily make the final 4"
"Phion Keneuf","Saturday at 1:10 PM","This should be the year we win the division"
"WTFMAN99","Saturday at 3:14 PM","Tampa basically looks like Stamkos and Sergachev out for McDonagh and Guentzel in....how much does it change?

I think BOS wins the division, they added Lindholm and Zadorov.

Toronto comes in 2nd

Buffalo takes 3rd

I think Florida might have lost a few too many pieces but could be wrong"
"Evilhomer","Saturday at 3:31 PM","Buffalo will miss the playoffs again."
"HamiltonNHL","Saturday at 3:48 PM","Leafs will play well and then choke when it counts. 

I’m hoping Marner and Tavares play well on PP2."
"","Sunday at 6:24 PM","They're potentially looking at another 3+ years from even sniffing at the post season."
"Jojalu","Sunday at 6:37 PM","Quite possible.

Here is hoping the blind squirrel finds that nut"
"Arzak","Sunday at 6:46 PM","I think we'll take 3rd, but hopefully, Berube can tell them to start on time or something and we'll win Atlantic for the first time?


Florida might still be up there. I can see them battling Bruins who got slightly better for the first place.

Bruins are still missing 1C. It will be interesting to see if they get one or try again next year."
"Evilhomer","Sunday at 7:31 PM","Who knows how long it will be, but they are not a playoff team this season. Nor are Ottawa or Detroit."
"Mr_Fun","Sunday at 8:45 PM","The previous coach let them get away with a few things and these guys took advantage of that. I don't think it was necessarily intentional but I think that may have been the reality, especially based off some of the comments. I think this is where Berube steps in and tightens up the ship a bit. With a little luck (Read: no significant injuries), I think this team has a good shot at winning the division if they come ready to play every night."
"mjd1001","Sunday at 9:39 PM","Its like a broken record, but this MIGHT be the year Ottawa or Buffalo takes a leap forward. Ottawa again had a lot of injuries, and if they can be fairly healthy, with better goaltending, I can't see them not being better. As for Buffalo, they missed the playoffs by 1 point 2 years ago, and last year they were a positive in goal differential (where 90-95% of teams that are positive make the playoffs) all the while their best player (Thompson) played most of the season hurt AND they didn't find their starting goaltender until the calendar turned to 2024 (after that point for more than the 2nd half of the season they allowed the 3rd least number of goals in the league).

At some point, Tampa and/or Boston are going to fall from the top, but also at some point Ottawa and/or Buffalo are going to surprise and actually be good, they both have too much young talent."
"weems","Sunday at 9:59 PM","Florida lost alot of puck moving and offensive ability with Montour and OEL leaving.
Their first pairing is strong with Forsling/Ekblad but the other two pairings are big question marks.
They have made the finals two years in a row and that takes alot out of you, so you could easily see a tired looking team in the regular season."
"Evilhomer","Sunday at 7:38 AM","I think Florida will drop a fair bit. Tampa will also drop again, but their top line will likely continue to carry them to a decent regular season. Boston should be steady, but not really improved over last season. None of Detroit, Buffalo or Ottawa are close enough yet. I think the division finishes Toronto/Boston/Tampa/Florida."
"Sypher04","Sunday at 7:49 AM","Yeah, I don't really see Tampa as having improved much if at all.

Boston I think is overrated. Their year last year was pretty inconsistent. They did not play nearly as well as their record would make you think. Lindholm is a good add, though somewhat offset by losing Debrusk up front. They definitely got softer at forward. There are reports Marchand is going to miss potentially months to start the season. Swayman isn't signed. Zadorov is a luxury add which won't move the needle for them at all imo. They needed forwards, not an overpaid #4.

I also think Florida will take a step back.

Buffalo though, they stink. I'm willing to bet they finish 7th or 8th in the division, behind the usual 4 and both Ottawa and Detroit. Maybe even Montreal.



I think one of Detroit or Ottawa takes the 2nd wildcard and gets in."
"Dekes For Days","Sunday at 8:06 AM","We won our division in 2021, and had some of the best President's Trophy winners through the cap era in our division in 2019, 2020, 2022, and 2023."
"Puckstuff","Sunday at 8:47 AM","I was referring to the Atlantic division but winning the Canadian division was impressive. Winning the Atlantic would be even more impressive."
"Anthrax442","Sunday at 10:23 AM","Every year for tha past 10 years people write off the Bruins, and every year they screw with us."
"Roo","Sunday at 11:08 AM","A well coached team with quality goaltending will do that. If Woll stays healthy and plays to his ability, and Berube gets them bought in and playing the right way, we have a great chance to win the division ."
"rumman","Sunday at 2:42 PM","Both teams will live or die on the performance of their goaltending, I yhonk both will be fine……."
"darrylsittler27","Sunday at 4:00 PM","I wouldnt overlook Detroit. Yzerman could make one really good trade and they are in the playoffs. Also, Ruff back in Buffalo will help them a lot. The whole East wont be fun next year."
"weems","Monday at 7:37 PM","Current odds"
"Jojalu","Monday at 8:16 PM","Vegas seems to over value the Leafs every year. They always have the Leafs at short odds to win the Cup even tho they struggle to get out of the first round.

Bos too. They have had the same struggles as the Leafs over the past 8 years but with a fraction more success in the playoffs"
"Evilhomer","Monday at 8:20 PM","Yes, but that is only because the odds follow the money. Has virtually nothing to do with a team's actual chance of winning."
"notbias","Monday at 8:21 PM","Because they set odds to make money, not on who they think will win.

Setting odds is very complex I am sure so I won't try to understand it outside of that."
"Dekes For Days","Monday at 8:57 PM","When actual money is on the line, logic and reason and information that's actually relevant tends to be prioritized over emotions from past losses."
"Racer88","Monday at 9:07 PM","Wasn’t the idea of the Shanny experiment to become cup winning team. The excuse that we played against good teams but couldn’t beat them is pretty sad.
Isn’t beating good teams the way to the top?
I think we will finish 3rd yet again because we are the third best in our division"
"Racer88","Monday at 9:16 PM","If that actually is the case then they need new odds makers"
"Americanadian","Monday at 9:47 PM","I have Ottawa and Toronto making it pretty soundly and only 3 total teams from the Atlantic making it.

As far as who makes it out of Florida/Boston/Tampa I don't feel confident in any prediction.

Ottawa was buried by bad goaltending last year. They have gone out and fixed that issue. Ullmark is 1 year separated from a Vezina and is a projected 14 point improvement over Korpisalo over 50 starts. Losing Chychrun for Jensen is an upgrade just for the fact that they need more defensive players and they need better left/right balance. Perron and Amadio are good depth adds that should help them win.

We'll see how Swayman does increasing his work load from a career high 44 GP last year to 55ish. Going from Ullmark to Korpisalo will cost them a few points (I have it projected as a 8 point difference over 27 starts). Lindholm is a good add but Debrusk is a big loss up front.

Tampa's bottom 6 is an issue as well as their back up goaltending. If they don't get an actual NHL caliber back up that will cost them the playoffs.

Florida didn't lose a ton but they did lose Stolarz who was the best goalie in the league by goals saved above expected per game. Going from Stolarz as the back up to Knight is a projected 6 point loss over 27 games. Losing Montour, their leading minute eater from the regular season (23:27 TOI) and replacing him with Schmidt (16:49 TOI) and Boqvist (18:47 TOI) will be a struggle during the regular season. Between OEL and Montour they lost 82% of their PP production from the back end last year.

I predict Toronto, Ottawa, Florida make the playoffs from the Atlantic in that order."
"conFABulator","Monday at 10:06 PM","I posted on this topic on another board. It was only July 9. Not too much has changed since then and I don't think Laine changes things too much. Here's what I wrote:

Florida. They got worse. No doubt about this one, right? Replacing Montour and OEL with Schmidt and Boqvist is a hit. They lost Tarasenko and goaltending took a hit with Stolarz leaving and Bob aging. SC hangover? 110 points last year. Did they lose 10 points in the standings? Under/over 100 points.

Boston. They seemed from have improved with Lindholm and Zadorov. Though Debrusk will be missed and many believe Zadorov is a third paring guy, an improvement over Grzelcyk but how much? Ullmark got them 51 points last year, maybe Swayman plays a bit more and Korpisalo is a decent back up. It's hard to see Boston improving on 109 points. Perhaps a slight step back with some aging parts? Under/over 105 points.

Toronto. They were the second highest scoring team in the league last year and only lost Bertuzzi and his 21 goals up front. They appear stronger on D with Tanev, OEL and Haakanpaa replacing Brodie, Klingberg and Giordano. Goaltending was a disaster last year, so they look to have improved there. New coach too. Tavares is a year older but some youth injected last year could offset any decline in production. A slight improvement on last year's 102 points with an under/over of 104 points.

Tampa. This seems like a crumbling empire being held together by duct tape. Stamkos and Sergachev for Guentzel and McDonough seems like a wash at best, possibly a step down. They lost a bit of depth and their core is aging and showing it. Another slight step back seems likely from their 98 points last year. Under/over 94 points.

Detroit. They didn't make many big moves and seemed to replace the guys they lost. It's hard to say that Cam Talbot is the reason they will be better, or even Tarasenko based on the impact we saw him not have on Ottawa. Young players continuing to improve might the reason we see a slight increase on their 91 points from last year. Under/over 94 points.

Buffalo. Much like Detroit, no real big additions or losses. It's hard to imagine Aube-Kubel or Lafferty moving the dial here. Health and continued development of the young guys could bring some improvement in the points and possibly standings. Even a sizable improvement on their 84 points from last year may not move them up the standings. Under/over 90 points.

Ottawa. They could be the most improved team in the division...and still not very good. They improved with Ullmark, Jensen, Perron, and Amadio in and really only Chychrun out. If Ullmark is very good and young core players continue to develop they could see a jump from their 78 points last year...to an under/over of 88. Trending in the right direction, but not enough

Montreal. They didn't add enough and can't expect seismic gains from too many of their young guys. They have some aging vets too. No real reason to forecast improvment and with others improving they have to get points from some where; a slight regression on last year's 76 points with an under/over of 74.

So, based on the above...

Boston 105
Toronto 104
Florida 100
Detroit 94
Tampa 94
Buffalo 90
Ottawa 88
Montreal 74

...did I miss the mark on any team in particular? Why?"
"conFABulator","Monday at 10:10 PM","I posted a lengthy post at the same time you posted this. I see Ottawa a bit differently than you do. I called them the most improved team in the division, I am not hating on them. I just think a 10-point improvement is a big jump. Ullmark is a great add, but I don't think you can take his Bruins numbers and project 14 more points for Ottawa. Ottawa's defensive game is not equal to Boston's.

A ten point jump still has them missing the playoffs in my projections."
"Evilhomer","Monday at 10:18 PM","Other than switching Toronto and Boston, and I think the spread between them will be 7 or 8 points, I agree with this."
"conFABulator","Monday at 10:36 PM","You might be right, I have underestimated Boston like 4 years in a row. I need to see them fall back before I believe they will I guess."
"Americanadian","Monday at 10:38 PM","Is 7 more wins over 50+ starts that unrealistic? Korpisalo was 21-26-4 last year. As far as the projections - I'm looking at goals saved above expected which factors in shot location. It's not a perfect indicator of defensive performance but it's much more accurate than just reading across save percentage.

As overall standings go I currently have:



That is not factoring in any mid-season trades. Cap space is based on 20 man starting lineups.


As far as Boston goes - the same model I am using for this season had them winning the presidents trophy in 22-23 and winning the Atlantic last year. This is the first year my model has them missing the playoffs."
"ThrowDemTongs","Monday at 11:22 PM","Who's winning the division?"
"BobClarkesfrontteeth","Yesterday at 12:23 AM","I definately agree with about 90% of your projections in your model. Point totals are low for some teams but placement is pretty pretty bang on. For the Atlantic I switched Ottawa and Buffalo. I just think Buffalo will not make the critical mistakes they made last year with thier goaltending. After January they were the 3rd best defensive team in the league. Ottawa is shockingly thin on depth with all the top end talent they have while also being a very light team after you get past Brady. It is a bad combo.
For everyone thinking Boston got better with Lindhom he had his lowest point total since 2017-2018. He had 3 straight years of decline in production while seeing 1st line minutes. Yet people on HF want Tavares moved to the wing or to the 3rd line while calling Lindholm a 1st line center. Funny thing perspective."
"conFABulator","Yesterday at 7:18 AM","Thanks,

I think you are projecting an increase of more than seven wins for Ottawa, no? I know you are saying seven in Ullmark's 40 games, which is a lot by the way, plus four or five more. I don't see that jump happening."
"crump","Yesterday at 7:37 AM","My best Amazing Kreskin thought. One or two of the traditional Atlantic bottom feeders is going to make a move into the playoffs. Ottawa or Buffalo. It will be tight, like “2 playoff spots for 4 east conference teams tight” in the last 2 games of the regular season. One or two of those spots will be Atlantic teams pushing for playoffs. I means Some team is going to have a disastrous season with over 90 points.


Gosh I hope Woll is healthy this season."
"Americanadian","Yesterday at 7:56 AM","7 wins over 50-55 starts, not 40.

I have them jumping up 23 points. The additional jump is from internal improvement. Can Stutzle return to a 40 goal player? How many additional points is Pinto worth over a full season? Can a healthy Chabot and Norris give them a few more points?"
"conFABulator","Yesterday at 8:00 AM","Sorry that was a typo. I meant 50, it is still a lot of additional wins. Everything in your post needs to break right.

Ullmark needs to healthy and very good. Stutzle needs a bounceback, Pinto needs to grow, Chabot needs to be something he hasn't been in a few years, Norris needs to be healthy and good.

Every team in the league would be better if everything broke their way. Why will it happen for Ottawa? You have them 15 points ahead of Tampa this year? It seems like a stretch."
"Dekes For Days","Yesterday at 8:05 AM","Everybody's objective is to become a cup winning team. Only one does it each year, and the path there can vary pretty drastically. The post isn't about that though. It's about the competition we've had to win the division. We won our division in 2021, and our 2022 season would have been President's trophy winning in 5 years of the cap era, but we had some of the best President's Trophy winners through the cap era in our division in 2019, 2020, 2022, and 2023.

The odds makers are fine. The issue is emotion on this board leading to incorrect conclusions."
"Americanadian","Yesterday at 8:20 AM","We’ll have to revisit this at the end of the season. I’m not projecting injuries for any team. It’s impossible to project.

As far as Tampa goes - they are heavily weighed downwards by having the worst goalie in the league as their back up. If they got a league average goalie they would be a 92 point team. Their bottom 6 is also starved for offense and they’ll struggle to win their minutes."
"Torontonian","Yesterday at 8:51 AM","Seems like it's going to be status quo for the top 4 teams. Where they finish could be a little different. Ottawa/DET/Buffalo I can see sniffing around one of the two wildcard spots. The biggest problem with the 3 I mentioned is every year they go on a a big losing skid or a few 5 game losing skids and can't stop the bleeding. 

The goal for Toronto should be to win the Atlantic, or the very least become 2nd and have home ice advantage. Berube focus should be getting the team to buy into a system that translates into the playoffs, and get Toronto's focus on point and stop pissing away games that cost them the division."
"conFABulator","Yesterday at 11:27 AM","Yep, we do have to wait and see and I am interested in your projection modeling. The back up goalie factor is interesting. 

This might be another reason why I don't see Ottawa making that big of a jump. A lot on Ullmark...staying healthy, playing a lot and continuing his level of play. They do not have a strong back up in Ottawa either and if he has to play 30+ games that is a factor as well."
"Americanadian","Yesterday at 11:37 AM","Forsberg is actually a very good back up. He was poor last year but his prior history in Ottawa is very strong. He had 33.6 goals saved above expected in 82 games (0.45 GSAA/60) for Ottawa from 2021 to 2023. Last year he had -5.9 GSAA in 30 games (-0.23 GSAA/60). If they can get something in the middle of 0.45 and -0.23 GSAA/60 that will be a position of strength for them."
"conFABulator","Yesterday at 11:40 AM","It is another ""if"" on the Ottawa ledger. I really don't want to come across as a Sens hater, though I am not a fan. I have them as a very improved team. I don't see a jump of 25 points in the standings, even just based on how tough the schedule and competition is. That's 12 or 13 more wins. 

I don't see it."
"Americanadian","Yesterday at 11:46 AM","We'll check back in 7 months.

Again - I'm assuming health for all teams."
"Racer88","Yesterday at 4:27 PM","I’m not so sure it’s emotions as much as it’s historical evidence the last 7-8 years that this core can’t get it done and you cannot build a cup contender when 4 core forwards consume over 50% of the cap.
So until someone builds a team like that and it wins we are correct and everything else is just wishful thinking or overly optimistic thinking


As far as the first response…….saying we would have won if there wasn’t better teams in our division is crazy.
Is that what you are really saying because I think all teams would be winners if they didn’t have to play better teams.
To be the best you have to beat the best……..competition 101"
"Sypher04","Yesterday at 5:13 PM","It’d be strange to see Carolina win the presidents trophy, especially by this large of a margin, after the tire fire of an offseason they just had."
"Evilhomer","Yesterday at 5:38 PM","I think Carolina will drop to third place in the Metro behind the Rangers and Devils."
"","Yesterday at 6:44 PM","Also if the Sens are looking like there's a reasonable chance they may miss the postseason and Ullmark remains reluctant to extend, we could easily see him moved before the tdl.

Imo they're heading back to the bottom half of the league yet again"
"Frostitute","Yesterday at 7:17 PM","Is this to make the playoffs?! If so it can't hurt to throw a bill on MTL. I wont miss it if they dont and woohoo if they do.


I wonder id you can just do a bet against the Leafs. Then either way I'd win."
"ThrowDemTongs","Yesterday at 7:40 PM","How is Boston a +450 to win the division? I don't get these odds. They've got them tied with TB. With us ahead by a bit and Florida ahead by a century


This is so strange to me"
"weems","Yesterday at 7:51 PM","Its the betting odds to win the division.

Vegas sets an innittial line, that will change throughout the season based on the money being bet on each."
"Dayjobdave","Today at 7:24 AM","The Atlantic looks like it will be really competitive this year which makes for a fun season. 

I hope the team is relatively healthy and they adapt to Berube out if the gate."
