"Top 6 Spaling","Jun 30, 2024","Eh, I don't see it that way. Askarov was great in the AHL, but not transcendent. He was #6 in GAA and #11 in SV%. I still think he has more to learn and do there and only getting him 20 starts total is, IMO, a disservice to his development. Who knows, I trust Mitch Korn above all here."
"Predsanddead24","Jun 30, 2024","This was essentially what we did with Saros early on and I think it was a good choice. As for Askarov's situation now that we've re-signed Saros (or at least will soon) I think Trotz is taking the right approach. Let people know you're willing to move him but only for a high price. Hopefully he keeps building his value and we're able to trade him for a haul at some point."

"","Jun 30, 2024","I posted the actual sum-up on the mains:

Wouldn't be my first recommendation for the Preds unless folks really think Josi needs to be taken off the PP. Would probably have to be paired with Lauzon."

"Dadof5boys","Jun 30, 2024","It's these kind of posts that had me go from a regular poster, to a lurker, to not coming here as much to discuss. I've been on these boards a long time before posts counts were started when HF used to actually rate prospects and did team ranking of prospects. I also posted more on the ESPN boards which only had a handful of posters. I only see, at least when I come to read, very few outlandish claims like trading for Bedard, but when someone is negative about an aspect of the team, the position of authority argument is often used. I'm glad to see that this has gotten much better lately, and I hope that it continues that way. 
On to the offseason discussion, I have my doubts that Barry is going to sway too far from the Poile way of doing things, and that is quite unfortunate for it has kept us, with very few exceptions, a mediocre team. Poile's strategy, which unfortunately wasn't extremely successful, was to build from the net out. Now during expansion when we had a very limited budget, I could see that strategy being fairly necessary to try to win hockey games and grow the sport in our area. Unfortunately, it has led us to adopting that way of building a team since its inception. We heavily rely on Vezina quality goaltending to just compete to get into the playoffs which unfortunately seems to be the mail goal of the ownership group. We seem to always be in neutral when it comes to decision making on direction of the team. We have never fully embraced a rebuild due to this; how many times did we hear a rebuild turn into a ""partial rebuild"", ""retool"", or competitive rebuild. Now with this said, it's going to be a hard sell to rebuild if you've just signed your Vezina quality goaltender to a multi-year a 62 million dollar contract. Also you still have very talented pieces. My hope, since in my opinion a full rebuild isn't in the cards, is that we go all in for 3 years being we have Josi and our corp signed for 3-5 more years then look to rebuild. My hope it that we go after a few of the big named free agents at forward and D. Id love Stammer and a Teravainen type of signing on the front end with a Dman like Zadarov on the back end. Hopefully, we don't see Zucker, or any of our other free agents near this team. Fill in the holes with youth and go from there."

"","Jun 30, 2024","With Saros in net we were always going to be too good to truly tank. After seeing how this team can play even with multiple mediocre players currently holding down roster spots ,I agree with this as well. Let's take our best shot with Josi and Saros and Forsberg and see what it gets us. Probably 3 years of 1st round exits but that would still be better than 3 years of finishing 10th and picking in the high teens at best"
"Top 6 Spaling","Jun 30, 2024","LeBrun says Carrier is re-signing with us. Curious to see terms but there's some depth. We needed at least two more D, including him."

"JD86","Jun 30, 2024","Assuming Stastney is with the NHL team, and he absolutely should be, they've got 6 D-men now. I was really hoping for an upgrade, so hopefully they're trading someone out or something.

Josi - Fabbro
Lauzon - Carrier
Stastney - Schenn

Not great, suppose they could just bench Fabbro again. But he's actually been alright with Josi"
"Predsanddead24","Jun 30, 2024","Yeah if we add someone to the mix and don’t move anyone out that’s a very full D. I still think it’s likely we move Fabbro though."

"Scoresberg","Jul 1, 2024","I wouldn't have wanted Carrier back either but considering the lack of RHD depth in the organization and a guy we wanted in Pesce choosing to go elsewhere, I get it. 

At the right price, he's fine as a 3rd pairing D and at times I really liked the Lauzon-Carrier pairing last year. 

-- 

In other news, it does sound like Trouba is on the outs from NY. In addition to signing Skjei, I would seriously consider going after him. His contract runs only for two more years so it's not a risk. NYR would also pay a price for us to take him on. 

This defense wouldn't look too shabby:

Josi - Trouba
Skjei - X
Lauzon - Carrier
Schenn

I am counting Fabbro out."
"Scoresberg","Jul 1, 2024","This is what should really happen. No more half-assing it. 

Though Trotz has dug himself a hole here, he has that three-year window to make this team competitive but for example next year we're paying players $11 mil not to play for us. That's huge hole in the roster."

"Bringer of Jollity","Jul 1, 2024","Well, Barry definitely had something else up his sleeve...top 2 free agent forwards are Preds. Crazy."
"Top 6 Spaling","Jul 1, 2024","As I said in the other thread, if the team direction was ""Go for it now"", that's the best FA period you can hope for. It's clear Trotz wants to build a contender that has a three year window starting now to get this thing done. We're still a top 4 D and a middle six center away from an ""ideal"" win-now roster, but that may change with 6M in cap space left and Asky, Glass, Fabbro, Tomasino, etc still available to be moved.

Even with all of these additions, the key is we didn't give away any of our prospects and did/will have multiple early picks in the drafts from 2022-2025. It almost feels like Trotz gave up on this latest class of young guns that would have created a window in 2026-2028 and said ""Screw it, 2024-2027 window, then we'll see if these guys like Molendyk, Kemmel, Wood, Asky, L'H, Svechkov, etc etc can open another in 2030"""
"herzausstein","Jul 1, 2024","With the additions, we have the proper high talent forward depth to spread around and properly insulate/teach young players. I hope we continue to bring young players up as possible but this will keep the Jankowski/smith type players off the 2nd line"
"ChicagoBlues","Jul 1, 2024","Loving what Nashville is doing AGAIN! Another great offseason, so far. You've got three young forwards pushing for a spot next season, so there is an organic, cost-controlled youth infusion coming soon. Draft capital is banked. Dead cap death numbers will fall off soon. A lot to like in Preds Land!! Your pipeline is way better than the Stars', so the Preds should be able to weather the upcoming age polarization on your roster better than the Stars have. 

Just my quick assessment of a division rival that I really like!! In a coupla years, the Blues will be right there with ya.

Best of luck!"

There's a naive fan in me that I guess is just excited to have Stamkos in gold, so I probably need to listen to TBL fans telling us he's already overpaid and tone down the expectations  

I hope Skjei is better than I had thought, because I wasn't expecting 7x7."
"weeze","Jul 2, 2024","Whether or not the Preds win the SC is moot to me. I mean i want them too!

The last two years of bringing in players has been nothing short of fantastic and a welcome change to the same old Preds way. ROR, Steven ""Freaken"" Stamkos, Jonathan Marchessault, Brady Skjei and Gus in the last two years!

"sparkle twin","Jul 5, 2024","Yes, they still give 2 plans to choose from, gold or blue. In the past each plan contained the home opener and season finale, but now you get one or the other. And you only get one preseason game per plan. 

Now that the schedule is out, they should be sending out the 2 plans in the next week or two. They usually give you a few weeks to decide.

Later in the summer they usually send out parking packages, too, and you can buy either the Pinnacle or Music City Center for whichever plan you pick. (I'm assuming they will still be offering those 2 garages.)

Just continue to watch your email!"

"glenngineer","Jul 5, 2024","Went to the 3 on 3 tournament today. Got to stand next to Trotz the entire time. His choice, not mine....haha.

It was an interesting format and while it was a competition and there was some physicality, I think the coaches asked them to dial it back so there wasn't a lot of checking.

Surin is as advertised. Super smart, dialed it up when he needed to. Has a rocket of a shot. Made one of the best passes on the tape for someone to tap it in. 

Stiga I didn't see a ton of but when I did, he's got good hands and is cerebral. He was annoyed at himself for not scoring a couple of times but he was a vocal leader on the ice and was able to cycle effectively. Only group who really did so and it paid off a couple of times. Also had a nice goal where his placement was perfect without laying into the shot. 

Gojsic is bigger than I was expecting. Has great wheels for his size. Also had one of the best shots to score a goal that I saw. Left wing side went top shelf opposite corner. Has a good compete level too.

Gustafson was a bit of a surprise. Could be a nice find. Solid hands and a bit chippy at times. 

Enjoyed watching Lind as he drove the net a few times and for a guy his size, he went there without hesitation. 

Fink was noticeable offensively. Had one fantastic pass setting up a teammate to score and had a goal where he head faked what seemed like 3 or 4 times and blew a wrister past the goalie. Could be a late round steal if he continues to develop.

Wood seemed like he wasn't into it. Then again, I may be expecting too much. Drove the net a bunch and hardly finished any plays. Needs work on this skating. 

Molendyk didn't do much offensively but wasn't noticeable defensively as he has great ice awareness.

Gibson had a nice day too. Moves really well for a larger guy. Not afraid to jump into the play. His group was in the finals and with a few seconds left, he got in front of shot to block it and you could tell it stung him but everyone from both teams gave the stick taps for his effort.

Always hard to tell with so many things going on at once. They had separated the ice into halves so I couldn't watch both games at the same time. Tried to focus on the guys I knew and tried to get a feel for them. 

I think Gojsic was the surprise player for me today. His speed, fluidness and burst were impressive. I also believe people are going to enjoy Surin. 

FYI, didn't talk to Trotz as I didn't want to interrupt him at work. 

Was fun to be at the rink today as I haven't had a chance to do this in a long time."

"Armourboy","Jul 6, 2024","I mean you could but then you are talking about trading everyone you can that makes 2 million or more and playing guys on ELC. Toronto has already shown that ain't exactly a great path to take."
"ShagDaddy","Jul 6, 2024","Big assumption here on my part but O’Reilly should be satisfied with the additions of Marchessault and Stamkos instead of getting Marner."
"","Jul 6, 2024","I'm pretty sure he was pushing for Marner before UFA day so didn't know we would be getting all those guys. I'd guess he's extremely happy right now"
"nullednumbed","Jul 7, 2024","After a few days of letting the dust settle my feelings are this going into the season. A caveat is that Trotz still probably needs to make a couple of more moves between now and the start. First and foremost to be able to see Steven Stamkos play for the Preds over the next few years is pretty damn awesome no matter how I feel about the team as a whole. Trotz picked a path to go down over the next several seasons so can't fault him for that.
I am still not convinced these older forwards, as great as they have been, will lead this team deep into the playoffs. I think one or more of Forsberg-ROR-Nyquist will regress. There is no Point or Kucherov for Stamkos - he will need to really elevate the Novaks of this team. Saros, though decent overall, did have a down year (insert ""5th in Vezina"" comements) and needs to find a way to not get stuck in such a slow start. No doubt still a solid goalie but man that 8-year contract with the no move stuff really kind of stinks. This team still really needs a dynamic center, and understandably those are really tough to come by. But that is something I think will hamstring this team a bit.
So in my way too early prediction I am thinking the Preds finish out right around where they did last season; a wild card entry. But I am more pumped this year to go see them play in person because #91 is one of the all-timers. Perhaps Trotz will also do something before the puck drops as well."
"Scoresberg","Jul 11, 2024","In case anyone still thinks we're in a re-tool..."
"ILikeItILoveIt","Jul 11, 2024","I'd say 29.8 years old is probably the apex of a hockey player's career, so I'd say we're in great shape."
"Porter Stoutheart","Jul 11, 2024","Wow, I'm shocked we're only #3. Ok, I knew we couldn't touch Pittsburgh. But I'm surprised Edmonton is ahead of us."
"Bringer of Jollity","Jul 11, 2024","Three different approaches to roster building in that top 3.

Penguins core players are 34, 36, 36, and 37
Oilers are 27 and 28
Preds are 29, 30, 34"
"Porter Stoutheart","Jul 11, 2024","Ahem, Saros-Forsberg-Josi-*Stamkos*-and probably Skjei now too... ? Maybe even O'Reilly, considering the minutes and role he has."
"Predsanddead24","Jul 11, 2024","It is interesting because aging curves built on a lot of different metrics suggest players peak between 26-29 and then decline in their 30s. We do have a lot of guys we are relying on now that are in over 30, but while those trends are useful at a macro level they aren't a guarantee of anything at the individual level. Marchesseault and Nyquist both had career years last season and Josi is still as good as he's ever been. O'Reilly and Stamkos while not quite as good as their peak both had great seasons last year too. So while their is definitely some risk in the old man roster approach we're taking I think it's an interesting moneyball type of approach. I can't remember another team going in so heavily on signing older vet types like we have the last couple of years so it'll be an interesting case study. Dallas is maybe the closest and hopefully we can have similar success transitioning into a younger core when the time comes like they have too."
"GeauxPreds1","Jul 11, 2024","While I’ve always wanted to see Nashville go into a full rebuild, I’m extremely happy they chose a side instead of staying in the mushy middle. Getting stamkos and Marchessault shows me that this organization is no longer afraid to swing big to compete and that’s a far cry from our last management. Yea we’re an older team but last year we was the 5th oldest team with zuckers and sherwoods on this team. Now we’re the 3rd with freaking stamkos and Marchessault. I’ll happily take that. I’m excited to see this team this year. More excited than I’ve been for a long time. We could complain about this or that or we can sit back and enjoy and realize that our team finally had the balls to push their chips in and say let’s go for this. I choose the latter. Let’s freaking Go"
"herzausstein","Jul 11, 2024","Yeah alot of our top role players are on the wrong side of 30. Some of them are just barely though. Skjei is 4 years younger than Josi atleast. Some of this will help smooth out the aging out situation with the top players. Our center situation isnt pretty still in terms of age."
"ShagDaddy","Jul 11, 2024","O’Reilly had his highest point season and his second best goal season at the age of 32 (last year)

Nyquist had his highest point season and his second best goal season at the age of 32 (last year)

No one can predict if they’ll be able to put up those numbers again but Brunette was able to get the most productive seasons out of them in their career. There’s no reason to believe that he can’t do the same with Stamkos and Marchessault. 

Even if O’Reilly and Nyquist point production falls off and Stamkos and Marchessault don’t replicate their point totals from last season, we should expect that Evangelista, Novak and Parsinnen will improve on their numbers from last year to make up for any drop off from the older () players. 

The group coming back from last year have a full grasp of Brunette’s system and hopefully O’Reilly, Forsberg and Nyquist can help Stamkos and Marchessault figure out the system quicker. This coming season should be a blast to watch. 

I’d also say that Saros now knows exactly what to expect from the group lay in front of him this year as opposed to the first half of last season so he should be able to have a better start to the season."
"Preds Partisan","Jul 11, 2024","I'm too lazy to look it up, but I think the Preds playoff roster was something like 6th oldest. Whatever it was, I always had this thousand yard stare at random fans who claimed that ""at least the young guys got a chance to play"". 

At least this older version of the roster is better, not just older."
"Porter Stoutheart","Jul 11, 2024","I mean, if ""older"" is based on the new UFA signings, yes. But last year before we signed those guys... I'm not at all sure it was ""better"" with our depthy depth filler guys."

We havent spent any futures of consequence. Still have all our prospects, still have all our picks, etc. The picks we did spend were to get young players like Gibson that only serve to make the future core stronger.

UFAs are like playing with house money. He is trying to maximize the current core without jeopardizing the future. Now if we trade off Askarov, Kemell, Etc for win-now pieces that would be pushing all our chips into the middle. Likely will see some prospect swaps at some still and some cap shuffling"
"101st_fan","Jul 12, 2024","There are five players on the roster with a cap hit between $2-3 million. The biggest question over the next two months is which of them gets traded off for picks and/or AHL level prospects to open up enough cap space for a replacement plus a 21st player on the roster. 
Glass? Fabbro? Schenn? Lauzon? Sissons?"
"","Jul 12, 2024","My actual hope is 3. Glass, Schenn and Fabbro."
"101st_fan","Jul 12, 2024","I don't see anyone taking on Schenn's contract. Glass is a fragile reclamation project with potential upside. Fabbro at his hit and short term is workable for a lot of teams. Lauzon and Sissons have moveable deals, but are Trotz/Bruno go to guys making their departure unlikely. 

My expectation is Glass or Fabbro."
"weeze","Jul 12, 2024","Yes it is a huge swing! Just as important to me it is a decision! Instead of floundering with safe picks/trades and maybe a good pickup they actually went out and brought in some high name players that are great players! Do something! Well they did! I wasn't sure about last years pickups in ROR and Gus but boy was I wrong and I will admit it. Adding these three new players will really help in many different ways!"
"weeze","Jul 12, 2024","If the rumors are correct in that it was Schenn that spoke with Stamkos to get him to come to Nashville, I don't see anyway that the Preds then turn around and trade or get rid of him. I believe Sissons is too valuable at his cost level so that would leave the last three. Also hear that the Preds org loves Lauzon so he may not be on that list so now down to two. Glass/Fabbro package deal for some picks anyone?"
"jumb0","Jul 12, 2024","I don't see Schenn going. It's going to be Fabbro and/or Glass"
"","Jul 12, 2024","I don't think we should expect much return for Glass, in fact he might lower the return for Fabbro."
"herzausstein","Jul 12, 2024","Cap movement is gonna be interesting....

We dont have many contracts that i can see us moving. Everyone over 3.75 million either brings too much value to the team (Forsberg, RoR, Josi, Etc) or was just extended (Carrier). That leaves those below: 
Novak - could possibly be moved especially if they see him as a winger and not a center. Brunette also waffles alot with his icetime... still if you have him centering someone like Marchessault and/or stamkos that line might produce alot.

Nyquist - coming off a huge year and the additions of Stamkos and Marchesseult added alot of veteran leadership which makes him more expendable. Still he had a huge year with forsberg and ror so i dont know why youd rock the boat.

Sissons - provides alot of secondary points and kills penalties. Good bottom 6 leadership. Valuable to a team seeking a 3C and vet leadership

Glass - young player, breaks a fair amount, no real trade value but would clear enough space for an extra player and can likely be replaced internally by Pärssinen. 

Schenn - supposedly played a big part in securing stamkos... brought in for rhd grit and honestly our rhd group is weak. Could be replaced internally by fabbro but fabbro lacks the desired intangibles for the 3rd pairing.

Fabbro - saw the doghouse alot last season. Would love a bounceback story because he isnt bad but i think he will be sacrificed if needed. 

Lauzon - was viewed as a 2nd pairing dman last season by brunette and his contract isnt bad. Would prefer him on the 3rd pairing but lauzon - schenn is an ugly pairing. I doubt he would be traded as his value to the team at 2 million isnt easy to replace. 

Everyone else makes little enough to be buried. 

Fabbro and Glass are who i think get moved. Outside chance to Novak, Sissons, and Nyquist. More than likely not schenn or lauzon."
"Porter Stoutheart","Jul 12, 2024","Whatever we do with this season's Cap crunch... it's also interesting to ponder how things will look projecting that lineup out to next summer...



Forsberg ($8.5M) - O'Reilly ($4.5M) - Nyquist ($3.185M)
Evangelista ($0.7975M) - Stamkos ($8M) - Marchessault ($5.5M)
Novak ($3.5M) - Glass ($2.5M) - Tomasino (RFA - $0.775M)
Jankowski ($0.800M) - Sissons ($2.857M) - Smith ($1M)
McCarron ($0.900M) - Parssinen (RFA - $0.775M)

Skjei ($7M) - Josi ($9.059M)
Lauzon ($2M) - Carrier ($3.75M)
Stastney/Del Gaizo (RFA - $0.775M) - Schenn ($2.75M)
Fabbro ($2.5M)

Saros ($5M)
Wedgewood ($1.5M)

Ekholm retention: $0.250M
Johansen retention: $4M
Turris Buyout: $2M
Duchene Buyout: $5.5556M

$89,7291M
 $88M





Next year, we can at least be very sure that Glass and Fabbro will be gone, anyway. One will have already departed prior to the current season, but I would be shocked if either was still around next season. Meanwhile, Nyquist will be a UFA. Evangelista will be ready for a raise on a bridge contract. If we only gave Parssinen a 1-year show-me, then hopefully he'll be ready for a raise too. Ditto Stastney/Del Gaizo. All the bottom end guys signed for 2 years so will still be around. I'll believe they play Molendyk straight out of junior when I see it. There isn't much change, therefore... 



Forsberg ($8.5M) - O'Reilly ($4.5M) - 
 - Stamkos ($8M) - Marchessault ($5.5M)
L'Heureux ($0.8633M) - - Novak ($3.5M)
Jankowski ($0.800M) - Sissons ($2.857M) - Smith ($1M)
McCarron ($0.900M) 

Skjei ($7M) - Josi ($9.059M)
Lauzon ($2M) - Carrier ($3.75M)
 - Schenn ($2.75M)


Saros ($7.74M)
Wedgewood ($1.5M)

Ekholm retention: $0.250M
Turris Buyout: $2M
Duchene Buyout: $6.5556M

$79.0249M
 ?$92M?


So even if there might be around $13M in Cap space, it will get chewed up pretty quickly... at least if our young players progress as hoped. Imagine Evangelista and Parssinen are good enough next season to get something like the Glass Bridge, that's $2.5M+$2.5M. Hopefully Stastney or Del Gaizo show themselves to be reasonable regular bottom-pair D. At least one of them at $1.5-$2M. Then fill out the roster with a couple of league minimum players at $775k... so you are looking at using up around $8M of that $13M. It would still leave enough room to replace Nyquist, but not with anybody very fancy, just a similar level of UFA signing. 

It's really 2026-27 when the slate is going to be wiped clean on a lot of Cap."
"braindead","Jul 12, 2024","For reasons identified above, don’t expect anyone other than Glass or Fabbro to be moved. Glass looks like he has negative trade value, might be substantially negative unfortunately. So Fabbro seems like the overwhelming favorite to move but I expect very little in return. I think there is a good chance we take a smaller bad salary back for one/both of those two guys in order to get some cap relief. Our leverage in the situation is not great."
"Armourboy","Jul 12, 2024","Glass isn't that far in the negative, too young and doesn't make enough for that. A 4th and a team like San Jose, Chicago, or Anaheim might give him a look. Heck I'd call up San Jose and tell them you will give them the 4th back they paid for Afanasyev."
"","Jul 12, 2024","They didn't give us a 4th for Egor they gave us Ozzy Wisenblatt"
"Porter Stoutheart","Jul 12, 2024","I just don't think that kind of option is open anymore... ? Some of those teams HAD room... except now they've filled those spots."
"herzausstein","Jul 12, 2024","Hopefully after this season, Evangelista is ready to replace Nyquist. Then depending on what goes on with Tomasino, tomasino replaces Evangelista on the 2nd line or we have kemell ready to move up. There's going to have to be some reliance on young players making the jump to deal with the cap implications. Svechkov, L'Heureux, and Kemell all had good seasons this past year. We will have to see what happens next year but one or more might be able to come up. 

After next season,

Forsberg ror Evangelista/Marchesseult
Stamkos Svechkov/Pärssinen Marchessault/Evangelista
L'Heureux/Novak Svechkov/Pärssinen Novak/Tomasino/Kemell

Just so many possibilities"
"Armourboy","Jul 12, 2024","Well then give him back"
"Kat Predator","Jul 12, 2024","That's a reasonable point, Stoneheart. I meant this from the perspective of the cap. The analogy is that every team walks in the door with a specific number of chips in terms of total cap space. Every GM then lays down bets in terms of those chips and the players he bets on.

Trotz spent all those chips. It's almost certain he has to undo some bets to get some breathing room under the cap in fact. That's all in and a change from Poile, who always seemed to leave a good bit of the cap unspent in case of a rainy day.

Obviously, and like you pointed out, there are a wider variety of flavors of bets that could've been made."
"Porter Stoutheart","Jul 20, 2024","I don't find the Preds ask very reasonable here. I guess I'm not shocked they'd want to keep him 2-way for the coming season, since he's still waiver exempt and they probably will send him down, regardless of his readiness. But then at least they should have offered 1-way money in Year 2.

Meanwhile Stastney probably should have just asked for 1-way $775k, his $$$ are a bit high for somebody who hasn't played regularly yet. But he's clearly ready. 

Never really a fan of the team dickering over nickels and dimes like this when players have clearly shown something."
"jumb0","Jul 20, 2024","Seems like a textbook negotiation. 
Team goes low, player goes high. Hopefully they meet in the middle."
"Porter Stoutheart","Jul 20, 2024","Since the Preds picked a 2-year term, it would seem like maybe they are trying to influence the process to land on a 2-way deal in Year 1, and a 1-way in Year 2. He'll be waiver exempt either way, though, so I'm not sure what the penny-pinching is all about. 

With the money the team is throwing around this year, whether they pay him $125k+callup$ or just a flat $775k is pretty small potatoes. I'm not sure I'd be worried about ""setting precedents"" here, because Stastney is 24, has looked good in his callups both of the last 2 seasons, and even good enough to get into playoff games last season. It's not like just any guy in the minors could ask for a 1-way deal if they gave him one. In his case he has shown enough to have actually earned it. 

And getting back to the Afanaseyev situation, I know no GM wants an ultimatum from his player, but Afanaseyev is another guy who wanted 1-way money and they preferred to just let him go than to give it to him. I mean, you can play hardball with your developed players like that if you really want to. But again, not just any minor leaguer is even going to be able to ask for this. Afanaseyev put up the great season in Milwaukee that was asked of him, didn't look out of place in his NHL stints - albeit with no production - and yet it was too much to pay him $775k instead of a minor league salary of $150k or $250k or whatever would have been tacked onto a 2-way deal. It's not going to kill the franchise to throw away a candidate 4th-line forward or 3rd-pair D. But at some point when they've reached a certain level of successful development you do just have to integrate them... and pay them. Not everybody is going to be an organizational Yes-Man and sign the Carrier contract and just trust that they'll be taken care of down the road. It's unrealistic to set that as a standard IMO. You put in all the development resources and invest the draft picks, you shouldn't balk at an extra few hundred k right at the finish line and throw all that investment out the window."
"","Jul 20, 2024","Yeah this seems like the classic example we have seen in the past with a 2 way deal year 1 and a 1 way deal year 2. Hopefully Preds sweeten the AHL money for the first year and it gets done"
"BigFatCat999","Jul 20, 2024","I’d be happy with Preds 1st yr, Stastney the 2nd"
"Armourboy","Jul 21, 2024","Arbiter probably goes 2 way first year and 1 way the 2nd, at least I would. Clearly a guy that should be up this season but understand he hasn't stuck yet. Year 2 should be a no brainer he is here so I award him the money.

That said the Arbiter may very well look at the fact we played him for the playoffs until he was injured, which is a sign he should be making NHL money, gives him 1 way on both years but at 775k.

Edit: Should add if Stastney is the one that filed neither he nor the Arbiter have control over the number of years. If the team says two then that is what it will be. That's part of the CBA."
"","Jul 21, 2024","When is the arbitration hearing? Would much rather they settle before a hearing. This should be an easy deal to make"
"herzausstein","Jul 21, 2024","Yeah he hasnt earned that 925K 1 way deal. Not yet anyways. I would also call Nashvilles a little low but we are against the cap and every couple 100K helps. Feel like somewhere in the middle on a 2 way with maybe higher pay in the minors. 

825000 NHL 300,000 AHL year 1
825000 1 way year 2 

Or something along those lines"
"","Jul 21, 2024","Disagree. He looked better than a few of our defenders every time he played. There is no reason for him to play in the AHL"
"herzausstein","Jul 21, 2024","Gotta disagree. 28 regular season games and 3 playoff games. Should he make the team out of camp sure. Has he earned a 1 way contract? No"
"","Jul 21, 2024","4 years of college 2 years in the AHL, he earned it."
"BigFatCat999","Jul 21, 2024","Anyone else go back to July 1 posts to get euphoria in? I’m still in thunder shock."
"Flgatorguy87","Jul 22, 2024","This morning in Toronto."
"weeze","Jul 22, 2024","Agreed. To say that the Preds really gave Afanaseyev a true shot is pretty lame. 17 games in 23 and 2 games in 24. Avg TOI around 11 min. Then in 24 he played 56 games for the Ads and had 27/27 for 54 pts. Seems like he did what was asked and worked on his game. He was a big guy at 6'4"" 212lbs which the Preds surely need! And young at 23yo. We tried Fagemo, Foudy, Gurianov and Beauvillier for more games and with basically no more points. At some point I can see the top players on the Ads saying WTH!"
"herzausstein","Jul 22, 2024","It isnt my money so i dont really have a dog in the fight but Trotz seems to care alot about players earning their contracts. Did Afanaseyev earn a good extended look at the NHL level? Yes. 

Did he earn a 1-way contract and a guaranteed roster spot? No. He'd need to play atleast half a season at the NHL level in a single year for me to think that. 

Does it matter to me because ultimately if things didnt pan out, he could be waived and cap completely buried? Nope. Not my money. Cap is where i pay attention. 

Does trotz think it would set a bad example to give a player with minimal NHL time and a 1-way contract? Id imagine so. Consider that every other player he is negotiating with this offseason falls into that bucket. Tomasino, Pärssinen, Stastney all have more NHL experience than Afanaseyev did and we know from Stastney's arbitration that atleast he is being asked for a 2-way contract. You give Afanaseyev one and theyre all going to demand one (as they should if that was the case). Tomasino and Pärssinen have cases since theyve both played over a full season worth of NHL games. Stastney only around 30 NHL games though has a much harder argument and Trotz is going to probably try to argue them all onto a 2-way contract."
"Porter Stoutheart","Jul 22, 2024","But the the thing is, a 1-way contract and a guaranteed roster spot are NOT the same thing. Lots of teams (ourselves included) have given players 1-way contracts. Several of our minor league veterans have been on them in recent years while playing in Milwaukee. 

You can NEVER give a guaranteed roster spot (well except via NMC). Not to anybody. I'm pretty sure that Afanaseyev wasn't asking for a NMC contract. But he almost certainly was asking for a 1-way deal. 

And it is completely normal to give a guy who did what he has done (and Stastney) 1-way contracts. But they still have to earn the roster spot. You can always waive them back down to Milwaukee if they don't make it. We've done that with several guys in recent seasons already. Heck, Jordan Gross had a 1-way contract in Milwaukee last season."
"herzausstein","Jul 22, 2024","The 1 way contracts we have given out have been to buy UFA years like with Jordan Gross, veteran AHL leadership with a fair amount of NHL time like Mark Jankowski, or players coming off ELC with more than a handful of NHL games. I dont recall us ever giving someone a 1-way contract to a RFA that had such little NHL experience. They dont have the negotiating power that the others do. Gross couldve gone anywhere so Poile paid him"
"Porter Stoutheart","Jul 22, 2024","Alas the death of CapFriendly for researching that. Aberg and Gaudreau had some 1-way years at some point. Mind you, we don't develop a lot of guys internally who are just depth guys playing out their ELCs, of course. Not that past precedents REALLY matter anyway, given it's Trotz's show now, so anything Poile did shouldn't count. 

Anyway, if we're going to pay minor league veterans on 1-way deals, I don't see what the big deal is about paying our best internal prospects like Afanaseyev 1-way money. He just proved he's as good as any of them at the AHL level. And would basically be a ""veteran leader"" himself if he got sent back there at this point. If anything, I'd use those contracts to reward our internal guys who rose to that level  buying external UFAs with those contracts. 

The distinction being made between veteran UFAs and internally developed players is a bad choice IMO... if it costs you the player. Now maybe a guy like Stastney has nowhere else to go like Afanaseyev did, and he's bound now by arbitration to a 2-year term now regardless. But we have a lot more good prospects than we ever used to, and hopefully more and more guys are going to be reaching a stage of AHL excellence like Afanaseyev did. If they aren't going to get paid by our organization, I would definitely urge more and more of them to go get paid somewhere else like he did."
"","Jul 22, 2024","Well shit. Stupid to take this hard a line with him"
"herzausstein","Jul 22, 2024","Freddy Gs last contracts with us were 2 way. Even his 1st ufa contract was a 2 way with Pittsburgh. The wild gave him a 1 way and he broke out. 

I personally dont mind 1 ways that are completely buriable but management seems to disagree typically. Seems like a silly sticking point with promising players"
"Porter Stoutheart","Jul 22, 2024","The 3rd year of Gaudreau's contract with us was 1-way, fwiw. But again, I don't really care, since he's a Poile guy. 

Bottom line still being I think it's only fair to pay your own internally-developed ""tweener"" candidates 1-way money *if* you are going to sign AHL veteran types to the same 1-way money. 

Now internal RFA guys don't really have MUCH choice, in reality. They can what? Sit out. Go to Russia or Switzerland or wherever? Well, it works if you are Afanaseyev maybe. But for the rest, you might as well take the 2-way deal, just be very good, and if the team sends you down hope you're good enough that somebody else claims you on waivers. 

Like if we're hard-balling Tomasino or Parssinen to take 2-way contracts... wellll... to me that's just unecessarily tough, but at the end of the day, they would still have to just take those offers. Then either they make the NHL money by sticking in the NHL, or they hope they get claimed on waivers by another NHL team and can still make the NHL money. It's actually a bad idea for them to file for arbitration (as it was for Stastney IMO) because if the team picks a 2-year term, you don't want that. You want the flexibility of a 1-year term, even if you have to swallow a 2-way contract and just pray to get a chance somewhere else on the waiver wire."
"weeze","Jul 23, 2024","To me it just looks bad to our own drafted players when they are asked to work on their game in Milwaukee for a few years and see what happens. Afanasyev played 3 seasons for the Ads. Season 1 he played 74 games and had 12/21/33 and 0 pts in PO's. Season 2 he went 13/13/26 then 16 games in PO's with 5/6/11. Then season 3 his stats were 27/27/54 then in PO's 5/4/9 in 15 games. Sprinkle in 19 NHL games in 2 years. Looked like the kid was progressing while the Preds were bringing in players that were not very good (Fagemo, Foudy, Gurianov, Beauvillier) and a few got a chance to play before him or basically any Ads forward. I think any of the top Ads forward, including Afanasyev, could have performed as well or better than any of the players GMBT brought in."
"herzausstein","Jul 23, 2024","Don't disagree. I still dont really understand why Egor wasn't given more than 2 games last year. We wanted to win but it isnt like Beauvillier was adding much to the party.

I understand why we gave the others a shot as well though. Fagemo has excellent production on the AHL level. Foudy was a free speedy player with some draft pedigree. Gurianov like Afanaseyev was playing very well in the AHL. We really didnt give Fagemo much of a shot either though. Only 4 games at the start of the season. Foudy and Gurianov got alot of runway to try and prove themselves though by comparison."
"weeze","Jul 23, 2024","Since 2017 the Preds have drafted 2 players who are playing full time in the NHL. They are Tolvanen and Vange. A few others have played a few games but are not regulars (Tomasino, Parssinen, Stastney). No player from 2021 and on have seen the NHL as of yet. Its amazing how some teams have drafted players that are playing now and the Preds seem to draft players and they are not playing."
"Predsanddead24","Jul 23, 2024","I get the point but we also didn’t have any draft picks in the first through third rounds in 2018 and Tomasino is 19th in GP in his draft class. For the 2021 draft class on very few players have made the NHL at all and even fewer have become full time players. The true test is going to be how we do in these next few years because we have enough high quality prospects that some of them should make the jump."
"herzausstein","Jul 23, 2024","I mean what do you really expect from the classes 2020 to now? Look at the 2020 draft class and outside of the top 10 there are only a few that have made it to the NHL full time. Evangelista is the exception there and Askarov was our 1st round pick. Goalies usually take a couple years at a minimum. How many picks outside of the top 10 from other teams have made it into the NHL full time for 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 drafts?


Now for the older drafts, it is pretty valid."
"Porter Stoutheart","Jul 23, 2024","I guess my main thing is, just because you have the leverage on these younger guys, do you REALLY need to use it in the most heavy-handed way possible? I don't think it should set a precedent to pay a guy a bit more once you see he is making the strides that put him in serious contention to earn a spot on your team. Another youngster who doesn't meet that threshold can't come along and ask for the same treatment, it's a high enough threshold. 

They're offering Stastney less than they're going to pay Gravel, for example. They give a 1-way deal (year 2 anyway) to Blankenburg. Ufko already outplayed Gross at the end of last year, now he's shuffled back behind Blankenburg too? Afanaseyev may or may not have made the team, but the same held for Gurianov or Jankowski. 

Anyway, they do have leverage to pay these younger guys less, and maybe there is an organizational philosophy that says, hey, if you are going to be an NHL player, you are also going to have to outplay the AHL veterans we've brought in and are paying more money to. ""Pay your dues"" - and keep paying for a couple extra years so that it's beyond any shadow of a doubt. Then when you've proven BOTH your worth as a player AND your loyalty to the organization, you're in. They won't lose everybody with this approach. But they'll lose some. We have drafted some Russians and they'll need to be careful with Askarov, Svechkov, Surin, they will always have the same option as Afanaseyev, pushing the ""loyalty"" part of that approach could be dangerous."
"","Jul 23, 2024","Just seems stupid and wasteful to me."

I'm tired of people blaming the front office for the failures of the players. It's on the players to make an impression and make his mark. Progress is nice, an imprint is even better. Also, the fact that he couldn't knock McC, Jank, Smith or Woody out of the lineup says all you need to know about him. Same could be said about Tomasino and Glass."
"MrJoshua","Jul 23, 2024","I still feel like health is the only thing stopping Glass. A full season without getting seriously injured might go a long way for his confidence and overall game."

"King Weber","Jul 24, 2024","I'll be real disappointed if even with the additions of Stamkos and Marchessault our PP is still middle of the pack or worse.

On paper, adding a righty one-timer option on the left dot like Stamkos and one of the best bumpers in the league in Marchessault should help the PP tremendously but we'll see how it translates on the ice"
"Porter Stoutheart","Jul 24, 2024","But the thing is, the player DIDN'T fail. He did as much as he needed to anyway to at least peek in the door. Now, everybody here is agreeing he still had MORE he needed to show in order to stick. Maybe he could have knocked out McCarron, Jankowski, or Smith, maybe he couldn't have and would have gone on waivers. Who knows. The point is, we threw him away before he even got the chance. 

Of course, there's another level of knowing the player, his training, his off-ice habits, having something more of an in-depth view of him than we see on the ice. So who knows, maybe he was just a guy the organization didn't like, and figured even if he did pan out to be as good or better than our depth guys, he wasn't going to be worth keeping in place of them, and that he had no ceiling to be so much better than them that you'd keep him despite his character flaws. I don't know, I'd have thought maybe some inkling of that would have trickled out before this, but maybe not. I bought a razor that says it really was just a case of him demanding a 1-way deal and Trotz getting his back up at the audacity of some young (23-year old) whippersnapper doing that."
"herzausstein","Jul 24, 2024","Is that possible though? The dude gets injured pretty easily. I imagine that has caused all sorts of anxiety on the ice for him. Id love to see him get going again as i think he could still have 2C potential but the odds of him ever getting there are pretty low


Nashville got to pick the contract length since Stastney chose to go to Arbitration correct? So it should be a two year deal"
"Armourboy","Jul 24, 2024","Two year deal is a given, its the details of the money that is the only thing to be determined.


He didn't really get a chance to beat those guys, not by this coaching staff anyways.

We'll be getting rid of someone to clear cap. It wouldn't make a lick of sense to waste the last retention spot and keep any part of a contract counting against the cap, when we're trying to do the polar opposite.

Getting something back and something that counts $0 against the cap, such as any draft pick at all, is clearly a better option."
"Porter Stoutheart","Aug 1, 2024","Somewhere I posted a roster whereby he could get through the Cap Compliance date with a short roster and Glass in the minors, right? 

As long as he is within that ""wiggle room"" of being compliant, there actually isn't any rush. In fact, he doesn't even have Parssinen and Tomasino signed at all yet. Injuries could arise in training camp. Or who knows, maybe Glass shows up in camp ready to make some noise and increases his market value from zero/negative to at least something - or at least to zero whereby he could actually get claimed on waivers.

So to me, assuming there are no non-negative offers even out there atm, there really is no rush at all. It may not actually get any harder later on, one of our many older folks might pull a groin in training camp, go on IR, and punt the question even further down the road."

"herzausstein","Aug 11, 2024","Rookie camp starts in 1 month. Summer is finally going to end."
"BigFatCat999","Aug 11, 2024","I am disappointed in myself. I thought I could find 5 ways the Preds can manipulate the cap; I only found 4. I know, I know, I suck, it's all my fault. Here is what I see so far; a 20 man roster. 
Which is fine, CBA rules state the minimum roster must be 18 skaters and 2 goalies. 23 is the MAXIMUM you can have. A game roster is the minimum; 18 skaters, 2 goalies. Now, lets talk about using the LTIR and roster manipulation. Let's say Saros were to come to coach's office and goes:

""*cough* I think I got the Vegas Flu. *cough* I need 6 weeks off... in Cancun."" 

Right at the beginning of pre-season. LTIR states you must miss 24 days and 10 games. That's the first month of the season. Imagine, October, you have a goalie pairing of Askarov and Wedgewood. 10 games. You get Askarov time to start vs. NHL teams. You rest Saros. Also, the Pre-season LTIR would cover the need for a couple $100K. Also a nice chunk of change for the regular season. Development wise, It would give Askarov NHL time and help shop him around the NHL. Win/Win. This would prevent the Preds from having to deal Fabbro or Glass. There would be finacial room for them *IF* a player, with a high cap is willing to play ball. 

There is the second way of trading a player. Problem is EVERY NHL team knows Nashville's cap and will do anything to screw them. This might lead to a Fabbro or a Glass on waivers. Plus, Nashville wants cap negativity. More picks or prospects? Philly is looking interesting with 3 1sts and 3 2nds

They could gamble on players getting hurt in camp...Problem is you don't know who gets hurt and for how long.

There is also thew mechanic of waiving Wedgewood. The difference capwise between Askarov and Wedgewood is a good chunk of change. Yes, there is a risk of someone claiming Wedgewood but Askarov is the insurance. (BTW, Matt Murray is not dog water either, The Matt M. on the Preds, not the other one, who might be a dog's breakfast.) 

Now for my minor concerns; there is a LOT of RHD in Milwaukee; Livingstone, Prokop, Ufko, Matier, Blankenburg, not to mention AHL contracts. And please note, Gibson will be of age to go to Milwaukee after this CHL season, same with Molendyk. I know Nashville has to provide players to Atlanta but a whole RHD side?

I wonder if the trade is to make camp room on the roster, not just cap space? I see one spot on the 3rd line and one on the 4th IF Glass is moved. One RHD IF Fabbro is moved for the 8 bajillion RHD. 

I say Philly because their young goalie of the future is going to Canada's version of Club Fed. Would they be interested in a package of Askarov, Fabbro, and Glass?

Also, Isn't nice to have 7 top 6 fowards?"
"Porter Stoutheart","Aug 11, 2024","FWIW if Wedgewood wasn’t claimed on waivers he has a 1-way contract so the buried Cap hit plus Askarov’s salary means you don’t save any Cap there."

"David Singleton","Aug 12, 2024","Placing someone  is typically not that easy. The League verifies that there is a legitimate injury or illness directly.

is where things get more fuzzy (and where any potential perceptions of abuse would typically get floated). Phrases like ""abundance of caution"" are mentioned when teams project a player's return from an injury.

I'm going through physical therapy sessions now with a lower back issue and, while the x-ray show arthritis and whatever else, there's still a lot ""how does it feel""-type of questions to determine  the physical therapy sessions will go on (or whether further imaging is necessary, etc.).

With injuries incurred by professional athletes, it's easy to see how stretching the rehab for these athletes can be justified (and be right) even if it also benefits the team from a cap situation."

"Porter Stoutheart","Aug 12, 2024","I don't think we really need to jump through any big crazy hoops to be Cap compliant for the coming season. We also don't need to rely on any injuries. All we really need to do is run a 21-man roster and waive Glass. 

If Glass doesn't get claimed, we'll be stuck with $1.35M on his buried hit, but that's ok, we will still be fine on the Cap. If he does get claimed and we lose his whole Cap hit then we're totally fine and can bring back the spares. 

Below I've assumed we ditch Tomasino one way or another, and that the team would rather carry a spare D - it could be Stastney or Del Gaizo, than a spare F. I just listed Del Gaizo on the basis of Stastney being waiver exempt, but either would fit, and I don't really think Del Gaizo would be claimed if we did waive him, so the 7th D can be either one of them, it doesn't cause us any issue either way.

We should probably hurry up and figure out Pärssinen and Tomasino because we honestly couldnt match much of anything without putting ourselves in a cap bind"
"Porter Stoutheart","Aug 13, 2024","I'm sure we wouldn't match anything on them anyway. 

I do like it anytime NHL teams try to challenge the status quo by going the offersheet route. The Blues have some Cap space, so why not use it. Those might be absolutely ludicrous salaries for Holloway and Broberg by the standards of their NHL accomplishments to date. But I guess if the Blues are ready to pay a 2nd+3rd+salary_overpay to get those guys, more power to them. It adds entertainment value to the league.

I'll tell the Blues this: Tomasino/Glass and Fabbro are much better players than Holloway and Broberg. You didn't have to go that far... we'd have very cheerfully taken the 2nd+3rd and you could have saved $$$. But you do you. It's fun to see."
"Predsanddead24","Aug 13, 2024","I know Broberg was good down the stretch in the playoffs but $5M for a guy who was a healthy scratch for most of last season is insane."
"Porter Stoutheart","Aug 13, 2024","Especially considering the caliber of the Edmonton defense. It's not like he was a scratch on a team that was just insanely loaded on D."
"","Aug 13, 2024","He's been on my radar as someone that could be a smart buy low (in terms of trade cost) guy for a while now. Blues betting that Broberg is about to blossom, as teased in playoffs. He might not, but the compensation to Oil isn't high cost for that bet (and Blues have the cap space). It's only 2 years too, so if he doesn't blossom it's not huge outlay. I love this for Blues (and league, bc offer sheets are fun). With his size, skating, defensive play, he seems like good bet that even if he isn't worth $ he will at least be a guy who is better than Blues other LHD options after Leddy."
"Scoresberg","Aug 13, 2024","I agree with the above, Holloway may not turn into much but Broberg will be a stud in this league. Just when he’s starting to hit his stride, the Blues strike. That’s smart."
"herzausstein","Aug 13, 2024","Gotta agree that Broberg is on the cusp of breaking out and Edmonton finds itself in a bad position with the LHD for the long term as he is really their only decent LHD prospect. Ekholm hits 35 this season and Nurse is an overpaid 2nd pairing LHD. They now dont have anyone lined up to take over Ekholm's role when his contract expires so theyll have to go shopping"
"Predsanddead24","Aug 13, 2024","FWIW Broberg's underlying numbers in the playoffs were pretty awful despite the good +/- and point totals. I know he has the draft pedigree too but I'd bet Broberg ends up being much closer to the guy who couldn't get in the lineup the last two seasons than the guy on the cusp of a breakout he appeared to be in the playoffs. That being said I also can understand why the Blues would be willing to take that risk with where they stand now."

Price you pay when you put yourself up against the cap with RFAs to sign. Even if we manage to get Pärssinen and Tomasino at league minimum, we would need to clear space. The other option is wait around and hope someone doesnt do to you what STL did to EDM."

"Kat Predator","Aug 13, 2024","Great person and high character guy.

He can easily be a solid middle 6 guy in terms of his abilities. His ceiling would be top line.

It's not a question about his potential, but about him staying healthy enough to play and/or figuring out how to rebound from injuries better. Since he was drafted, he has been constantly getting injured and dinged. Constantly missing time, rehabbing, resetting and working to get back to square 0. It's been a total cluster for his career throughout.

He didn't fit our new direction, which is veteran heavy. He didn't seem to fit our new system, which leans into heavy pressure and constant in-your-sweater checking and away from other attributes. For a younger player who's constantly working his way back from the ice tub and trainer's table, that's not a good match. Couple that with him having a contract more than bare minimum, and he was predictably expendable. I wouldn't fault him for that; he got the contract on what he was doing at the time, but we've clearly moved in a new direction now."
"Porter Stoutheart","Aug 14, 2024","Should have just bought out Glass rather than lose draft picks to move him. Of course, they didn’t know during the buyout window that they’d land the free agents they did. Still, might at least have tried him on waivers first. Oh well."

"Armourboy","Aug 14, 2024","Agreed. It's the same thing but I look at it a bit different, we didn't dump Glass, we traded Glass, a 3rd, and a 6th for 2.5 million in cap space, Tomasino, Parsinnen, and Del Gaizo.

Without that cap space, you are missing a couple of those guys."
"","Aug 14, 2024","Yeah, I'd much rather give up a 3rd than have zero cap room. Price we knew we'd have to pay after going all-in with FA"
"Scoresberg","Aug 14, 2024","I really like that trade. Like I've said, I think it's addition by substraction for our team as it creates room for Pärssinen and/or Tomasino. 

Glass was a really likeable guy but honestly, I don't see him being in the league for long."
"Porter Stoutheart","Aug 14, 2024","Glass is young enough to qualify for the 1/3rd buyout though, so his buyout Cap hit was only $416,667. 

Anyway, like I said they didn't know they'd land all those big ticket UFAs, so it's kind of a moot point, they didn't know while the window was open that they'd be that tight on the Cap. In hindsight I'd have preferred the buyout, because we didn't need the full $2.5M saved, $2.1M would have been sufficient. Unless we see Tomasino and Parssinen sign for a lot more than I am expecting."
"Porter Stoutheart","Aug 14, 2024","I guess the way I look at it, you'd only have been missing a couple of those guys temporarily, until we got an injury, which inevitably we will. Or until Glass had a good enough game that somebody felt like claiming him on waivers. 

I still think we'll be ""missing"" Tomasino regardless, since they won't keep him around. They still might not even sign him depending on what he's asking for. Even with the extra Cap space opened up.

If anything, what this does might be more along the lines of opening up space to sign a ""leftover"" veteran UFA. If there's a guy out there desperate enough to take a $775k deal just to stay in the league, or guys we might want to invite on training camp tryouts, and one of them looks good, we now have room for that. Or to snatch somebody on waivers who another team sends down at the end of camp."

Personally, I would not be going the route of signing any leftover veteran UFAs, but there are a few guys out there who might take a league minimum deal for 1-year just to stay in the league.

In fact, I would go out and sign Kevin Lankinen to a 1-year $1M 1-way contract right now, today. I bet Lankinen is willing to battle Wedgewood. And the loser is going to be a great starter for Milwaukee. Murray is pretty good too. He might also be better than Askarov atm. But send the message."
"herzausstein","Aug 19, 2024","At the end of the day, this is looking like itll be a wasted pick. We either dont get good value in a trade or he ends up back in Russia to waste away. Lundell, Jarvis, Guhle, and Mercer all taken shortly after him."
"Roman Yoshi","Aug 19, 2024","Yeah, I mean who didn't see this coming? I think we all did. 

This goes back to I wish we had moved him before it got to this point. Now you have a fairly unmovable asset in that you won't get the return for him that warrants a trade/what you would've gotten for him earlier this summer. 

Frustrating situation all around and not really anything that is a ""surprise""

I would try to package him with Tomasino to get a quality prospect back, even if it is an L overall."
"Top 6 Spaling","Aug 19, 2024","He's in no place to make those demands, as others have said. Quite the ego on this kid.

I wonder how much of it is ""I want a spot this year"" vs frustration at the long Saros extension. He doesn't see a present here or a future here - not a great spot to be in. If we can't get fair value, let him go back to Russia. And never take a freaking goalie in the first round again!"
"","Aug 19, 2024","Goalies like this don't come available very often, I'm guessing (hoping) we might get a bidding war for him."
"jumb0","Aug 19, 2024","Hope the other clubs still value him and aren't turned off by his attitude. 
He has proven nothing and is making demands based on projection and supposed pedigree.

If another team is willing to give us value for him then boot his ass and if not I agree with those that are saying make an example of him. Hold him hostage until he realizes he doesn't run the franchise."
"Porter Stoutheart","Aug 19, 2024","This helps spice up the offseason anyway!

"BigFatCat999","Aug 19, 2024","Let the Askarov auction begin!"
"Top 6 Spaling","Aug 19, 2024","Before the offer sheet shenanigans, I would have suggested Broberg as a decent option for a return"
"","Aug 19, 2024","This shouldn’t be a shock. Friedman has previously reported that Askarov doesn’t want to play in AHL again. Another example of why risk in drafting Russian prospects remain. They’ve reportedly been shopping him for a while and with Saros extension an Askarov deal feels inevitable (although not necessarily imminent)."
"herzausstein","Aug 19, 2024","I guess the bright side of capfriendly being gone is that i dont have to wade through hundreds of Askarov trades now."
"herzausstein","Aug 19, 2024","I think the bigger issue is that at the time of Askarov's draft, saros already was becoming a mainstay in the NHL. His 19-20 season was a tandem effort with Rinne (both having around 40 games).
Career stats at end of 19-20 season
119 GP
104 GS
.918 sv%
2.56 GAA
Age: 25

With top end goalies usually lasting into their mid-30s, we spent our best 1st round pick since 2008 on another goalie (or 2014 for the last 11th overall pick). A goalie doesnt take 10 years to develop. Id argue whether or not Askarov is ready to be NHL backup or not but he will certainly be ready long before Saros' extension is done. Had areas of more need in the organization and similar quality prospects on the board and we went with a goalie."
"herzausstein","Aug 19, 2024","From a financial viewpoint for him id see it like this:

Last year of ELC

ive got a signing bonus this year 
If i dont get nhl time this season, i will be in line for a significant paycut next contract at the AHL and NHL level and have no bargaining power. 

The organization just extended their current starter for 8 seasons with a NMC meaning he likely goes nowhere.

I have no route to becoming a starter here and they signed a NHL level backup for 2 seasons... this lowers my odds of making NHL this and next season. It isnt impossible to overtake Wedgie but Trotz/Brunette have pushed other young players down to MIL in favor of vets so i dont favor my odds. 

Even if i do make it to NHL backup in Nashville, what is my ceiling here? Saros' starts so many games... how many games will/can i get? 

Then take into account he is far from family/home to deal with this stuff."
"Roman Yoshi","Aug 19, 2024","IMHO: it's not that he doesn't want to compete for a roster spot today: it's that he doesn't see a future as a whole.

How many of us have switched jobs because someone has else was promoted above us? Or a reorg that meant we had no path to continue to move up the ladder. 

I think as fans we want what is best for the team and sometimes we forgot this is these guys CAREERS. 

Of course with Saros extended that long Askarov is going to worry about his future with the team short term and long term. He wants to be the guy and thinks he can be. He doesn't have a lot of leverage and is playing the only card he can. 

IMHO when the Preds decided to extend Saros Askarov should've been moved the same day/that week, even if the return wasn't as good as you wanted it to be because I doubt the return will be as good now as it was then, even with a bidding war."
"weeze","Aug 19, 2024","True. The play the kids does not seem to be the Trotz/Brunette way, at least at this time. And he will probably not be the last if this is how Trotz continues to run or treat our draft players."
"BigFatCat999","Aug 19, 2024","Frascas OHL rights traded to Erie"
"","Aug 19, 2024","Agreed. I generally don't want to take ANY goalie in top half of 1st round because their path to being worth pick is so narrow that even if you are right on them, you still often don't get value there because between draft and when they are ready for NHL so much can happen to your club independent of them."
"herzausstein","Aug 19, 2024","If we were still riding Rinne at the time and didnt have a viable replacement in the pipeline, then sure i get drafting askarov. Saros already had 1 split season start with Rinne and was looking outstanding. It is one thing when your starter is nearing retirement. It is another thing when you have someone just stepping into the starting position and having about 8-10 years infront of them."
"Top 6 Spaling","Aug 19, 2024","I hope the moral we take away here is we should avoid drafting *goalies* in the first round, not Russians. Just too much risk and, unlike forwards or D, all it takes is one cemented starter and they have no path."
"originalpredfan","Aug 19, 2024","I was very surprised at the timing and extent of the contract that Saros received when it happened. When thinking about it I could only surmise that between Trotz and Korn a decision was reached that Saros was somehow going to become a consistent top notch goalie, and Askarov was not going to develop to their satisfaction. While I still worry about his slow starts and his weakness in covering the top part of the net, I assume Korn will be able to coach him up. If not, I imagine our new focus on offense will really have to step up. If my assumption is correct than I don't understand why they didn't immediately try to move Askarov, unless they totally misread his mindset. For the record I am not in favor of Players dictating terms to management."
"wmupreds","Aug 19, 2024","The writing was on the wall here when the team committed to Saros for 9 years. I'm not sure anyone exactly saw it happening this fast but many of us warned about the asset management side and that signing Saros this long was it's own huge risk given aging and that it'd result in likely losing the org's #1 prospect for middling value.

Now obviously the middling value part isn't set in stone but I'd be surprised at anything else at this point given the circumstances."
"herzausstein","Aug 19, 2024","I personally see the moral as

""If you have a young starting goalie, you dont waste high round draft picks on goalies. Throw a couple late and mid round picks (4-7) out there until the starter hits 29 then start maybe a few 2nd/3rd round picks here and there until a new future goalie is found."""
"Porter Stoutheart","Aug 19, 2024","That's a different Frasca, btw. Ours is 23 years old and bound for Atlanta ECHL. Might be his younger brother?"
"","Aug 19, 2024","I don't blame Asksy for wanting a trade, even if he isn't ready for The Show. The way is shut here and he needs to do what is best for his career. 

I still think the Saros contract is too long and will cause issues down the road. He is adequate to good at times. But he will wear down and we have nothing to replace him with. 

Trotz really doesn't like Poile's picks over the last few years. He has been getting rid of them or riding them out of town. I don't agree with this approach any more than I liked Poile's ""safe"" way."
"Armourboy","Aug 19, 2024","Wanting a trade is one thing, telling a team you won't report when you are under contract is a different story.

Askarov has done nothing to expect a job in the NHL handed to him. 

Trotz has no choice, he either gets good value from another team or you suspend him if he doesn't show up. If the return isn't at least a 1st you let him bury his career in Russia."
"herzausstein","Aug 19, 2024","I guess this will be a good test of Trotz' GM abilities. What can he turn this turd sandwhich into?"
"","Aug 19, 2024","So far, he's showed patience. The Askarov rumors have been around for a while now. He didn't bite on any possible offers at the draft. Hopefully, he's not biting off more than he can chew, but at least he didn't just grab a crappy pick and just cash it in."
"herzausstein","Aug 19, 2024","You sit too long you get nothing. That will be the danger here. Granted worst comes to worst... he is suspended and plays overseas where he continues to develop."
"","Aug 19, 2024","Very true. There's definitely a balance. That said, Askarov has the most at risk. It seems that he feels he's ready for the big stage and a big contract. Sitting at home while others get those rewards humble most. We'll see."
"Roman Yoshi","Aug 19, 2024","Letting him bury his career in Russia is dumb. That's bad asset management"
"Porter Stoutheart","Aug 19, 2024","Or it might help show others like Svechkov and Surin and future generations that you can't hold Trotz hostage, that burying your career in Russia isn't the best bluff?"
"Armourboy","Aug 19, 2024","If the return isn't that good then it doesn't matter. A 3rd and a crap prospect doesn't beat out the value of showing him and future players this garbage isn't going to happen. Besides, if he doesn't play this season he can't even go back to Russia.

Askarov and the agent are stupid, this is the push you make when you have an alternative, right now they have none."
"Porter Stoutheart","Aug 19, 2024","This could backfire spectacularly on Askarov if Trotz wants to make an example out of him. 

He's probably lucky that Trotz is a bit of a softie at heart, and will probably let him off easy. But Askarov wasn't bringing anything to the Preds' current competitiveness whatsoever, so it could very easily have resulted in Trotz just calling his bluff. I still hope that happens. But I wouldn't say I'm expecting it. I still think Trotz will end up just taking whatever the best offer that comes across his table is. Even if that's like a 2nd round pick. Alas."
"LeighDx59","Aug 19, 2024","I'm more frustrated looking back because on was high on Nashville taking Lundell in that draft.

The situation sucks, I get both points of view on this. Its not like he's completely blocking from being the backup. they can always waive Wedgewood is Askarov outplays him, but the future beyond that is really bleak for Askarov."
"Roman Yoshi","Aug 19, 2024","We have a lot bigger issues if that is a genuine concern. Maybe actually playing the youngsters would help them feel like they have a place in the organization."
"Predsanddead24","Aug 19, 2024","Yeah the fact that the next two picks are both already well established NHLers definitely makes the situation feel way worse. As far as Askarov v Wedgewood I think it's pretty unlikely we would actually waive Wedgewood unless Askarov played significantly better than him. Different GM but reminds me a lot of the Ingram/Lankinen situation where it's nominally a competition but the decision has mostly been made. Doubly so since Askarov is waiver exempt unlike Ingram was."
"Porter Stoutheart","Aug 19, 2024","His ""in"" would more likely have been coming in as an injury replacement and just playing so well they couldn't send him back. Which could have happened at any time, including in training camp. 

Clearly they do think he needs more work, hence the Wedgewood signing to begin with, so it would take something exceptional to change that plan. He should have just recognized himself that he still needs that work. Oh well."
"Kat Predator","Aug 19, 2024","People react to challenges in different ways. If the boss promotes the other guy, you can take it personally as a door closing forever and sulk in a corner.

Or you can take it as an opportunity to up your own game. Why were you passed over? What can you improve upon? How do you make the entire team successful? Taking the time to hone your craft, prove to everyone your abilities, and new doors will open, some of them very unexpectedly.

Everyone in the top professional sports leagues oozes talent. Pedigree and raw talent aren't determinative of greatness. If it were, draft picks would be slam dunks and never busts and they could hand out championships on opening day rather than play the games."
"glenngineer","Aug 20, 2024","It’s funny that we can bash Asky for not winning in the AHL playoffs yet defend Saros for not winning in the NHL playoffs."
"101st_fan","Aug 20, 2024","You don't bring Mitch Korn back into the organization if there isn't a need. Askarov is still developing and the organization clearly thinks he could use more time starting in the AHL vs backing up with the big club. 

Now back to the usual comments where HF complains that players that failed to fill their expected role with the big club and don't even make the top 100 point per game scorers in the AHL are ""overcooked"" and somehow ready .... while simultaneously calling for them to take a 10% NHL pay cut which runs counter to the value they allegedly bring."
"Armourboy","Aug 20, 2024","I get it, I was ticked when Poile made that pick and even said at the time it would come back to get us. 

Thing is this, if Poile had still been GM I don't think Saros gets the deal he got from Trotz. I think once he got Askarov, Poile always viewed Saros as a stop gap, not the next franchise goalie. I think if you stick Poile in this situation Saros hasn't been extended yet, and he is riding him til the end of the year.

The pick makes sense if you come at it from that angle. I think Poile viewed Askarov as the next franchise goalie, not Saros."
"","Aug 20, 2024","Well, yeah...nobody is debating that. The point is that Askarov apparently doesn't want anything to do with Mitch Korn developing him in the AHL. Not while a starter in front of him has a fresh 8-year contract. So, the question is, now what?"
"Armourboy","Aug 20, 2024","Yet another reason Askarov is getting ahead of himself. 

Trotz has already said in interviews that Korn was brought in to round out Askarov's game, to smooth out the rough edges on his fundamentals so he is ready to be a beast in the NHL.

Trotz would actually be doing him a favor because if he does those things with Korn he is going to be putting serious pressure on Saros, which then sets Askarov up to be able to be moved and guarantee he is in the NHL. 

It makes it easier on Trotz to move him and also means he can tender offsheets at that point too. Right now all he has done is frustrated the organization and made it harder for him to be moved."
"101st_fan","Aug 20, 2024","If a player isn't mentally capable of winning a job then they aren't ready to be in the NHL. The mentality Askarov is showing might be part of why he's lost the starter's net a couple of times already. If Askarov makes a case for himself on the ice he can take the NHL backup spot in camp .... if Saros hits a rough patch, Asky can get a shot the starter's net. This is a league where Bobrovsky sat as the backup at $10mil per season. But Askarov wants to make grandiose statements with no leverage."
"","Aug 20, 2024","I'm not defending Saros. But the team made the decision they made based on going for it these next two or three years. Askarov probably could have won the backup spot at some point this year and then when our window closes we would probably be looking to move Saros. But he's laid down his cards(a pair of fives, but still) and he will now face the consequences"
"Predsanddead24","Aug 20, 2024","You could have a goaltending tandem of prime Hasek and Brodyer with Roy in the minors and I’d still think you’d put Korn into the mix given the opportunity. Korn is essentially a perk of getting Trotz."
"glenngineer","Aug 20, 2024","I totally agree with you and understand why Trotz did what he did. While I’m excited about the additions history has shown most teams don’t win Cups with a core in their 30’s so it’ll be interesting to see how this plays out. I still see the possible 4th line we’ll be icing and it’s not inspiring. I forget who’s post it was who showed the potential lineup and I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh noooo. 

At the very least, we should be a lot more fun to watch this year."

"Scoresberg","Aug 20, 2024","How do you move Saros when he has a NMC?"
"herzausstein","Aug 20, 2024","Ask him really nicely. If you are lucky, he will give you a place or two that he would go to. If you are really lucky, those places also need a goalie."
"Top 6 Spaling","Aug 20, 2024","Wow, that is excellent news for us. I wonder if Glass gets dealt if this happens last week.

Lots more flexibility for a deadline move, if nothing else. Or we can take back a player with a decent cap hit in return for Askarov."
"","Aug 20, 2024","What does that do to that dead space? Does it fully terminate?"
"Armourboy","Aug 20, 2024","Yep. If the contract is gone there is nothing to retain on so we get that back."
"Porter Stoutheart","Aug 20, 2024","I guess that's a moot point today. 

It was obviously something to think about before all this. But now we are just going to cross our fingers that Saros lasts 9 more years. That was Trotz's gamble, now he's going to have to just sit back and see if it pays off like he thought it would."
"Armourboy","Aug 20, 2024","Tell him he is going to be the back up if he doesn't waive."
"","Aug 20, 2024","Huge! Isn't that like $5 mil and had like 2 or 3 years left?"
"Scoresberg","Aug 20, 2024","That's also would've factored in that Saros maintained his level of play and was in tradeable form in 3-5 years from now. At which point he'd still had 4-6 years of his deal left."
"Predsanddead24","Aug 20, 2024","$4M for just this season is our portion. Would be nice to have some wiggle room to add at the deadline if we want though. 

As an aside, I'm just really interested to see how this whole thing plays out. It is sort of suspicious that Johansen was capable of playing for the Avs but then all of a sudden had a career threatening injury once the Flyers tried to send him down. I believe he's dealing with chronic injuries but I'm not sure it's really justifiable to pick and choose when you're able to play through them."
"Porter Stoutheart","Aug 20, 2024","Crazy RyJo just turned 32. I mean, he has looked older and slower since the beginning I guess. But players should still have something left at that age, feel sorry for him that he fell off like that. Well I guess we can't feel too sorry after paying him $8M all those years. Oh well."
"herzausstein","Aug 20, 2024","If RyJos 4 million in cap can successfully disappear, that would give us 7 million to fill out the roster with the remaining RFAs. We would also regain our retention slot giving us 2 for the deadline should we need them. Considering we are angling to compete i dont think we will sell off unless things go really sideways."
"Flgatorguy87","Aug 20, 2024","RyJo news is potentially HUGE. Really interested to see how this progresses. When would we hear if this is official, and our cap space is free?"
"BigFatCat999","Aug 20, 2024","He will appeal might not see the $ till TDL"
"Predsanddead24","Aug 20, 2024","Richards is the best comparison of the top of my head. The Kings terminated his contract on June 29th and they settled in court on October 9th. Reading some old articles it looks like even after the settlement the Kings still had to pay a recapture penalty for the contract and a smaller cap hit based on the settlement too. So I guess the answer is who knows what will happen and how it will effect our cap."
"Porter Stoutheart","Aug 20, 2024","I guess it will depend on how strong Philly's case is. I would imagine they didn't take this step unless they thought they had all the i's dotted and t's crossed in terms of backing up their case. So IF they have done all their homework, the appeal might not drag out very long.

It's not like there are (m)any UFAs left to spend money on. And teams mostly have their rosters set up already, so not a lot of ""Cap casualty"" cuts out there to be had. I guess there are RFAs who could be offersheeted?"

"herzausstein","Aug 26, 2024","I think one of del gaizo or Stastney gets sent down. Stastney if they really think Del Gaizo gets picked up or Del Gaizo if they think he will pass through like Carrier did a couple years ago."
"Scoresberg","Aug 26, 2024","No one's going to claim Del Gaizo. They will keep the better of the two, which I believe will end up being Statsney."
"herzausstein","Aug 26, 2024","This is likely though i do also believe del gaizo has played well when given a shot at the NHL level. I think either would mesh well with Schenn"
"","Aug 26, 2024","I admit I haven't seen much of Del Gaizo, but this makes sense to me. He seems like the kind of slightly undersized, moderately skilled, good AHL defenseman who can fill in when needed, but based on his stats and pedigree, doesn't really project as NH regular. A guy who can play well in limited minutes but you don't want to ask too much of. Seems like a Calle Rosen type. Does this track with what y'all have seen?"
"Armourboy","Aug 26, 2024","I think he is good enough to be an every day 3rd pairing guy, but that is probably about his limit. I don't think he is really a guy you need to shelter, there just isn't enough there that you would want to play him more than that."
"","Aug 26, 2024","That makes sense. Those type of guys tend to clear prior to opening night, because nearly every team has a guy they think can be at least that. As season goes along and many realize that they don't, chances of getting claimed may increase, but realistically almost everyone (without 1st round pedigree) clears."
"herzausstein","Aug 26, 2024","Much of the same thoughts. He may have 2nd pairing upside depending on his partner but probably never gets as good as Carrier. In the grand scheme of things, i think more of Stastney than him but i think both could be NHL players. Both are likely pushed out by Skjei, Lauzon, and Molendyk at the end of the day but maybe one manages to hold on long enough to stay 3rd pairing once Lauzon's contract expires."
"Armourboy","Aug 27, 2024","Well Stastney I see a little differently. That guy has something to his game that I could see him being a 2nd pairing guy long term. He's pretty calm on the ice and seems to make the correct play with the puck, and he can skate. Now, he may end up being pushed out due to other talent but I think if that is the case someone will pick him and be very happy they did.

He has way better upside than Lauzon imo."
"herzausstein","Aug 27, 2024","Luckily... Lauzon only has 2 more seasons under contract

Unfortunately, i think they really like his playstyle and with our upcoming crop of players we really do need some physicality. Most of the young crop are on the smaller side and rely on mobility to defend. We do have some bigger dmen as well but not sure how close any of them are to NHL time."
"","Aug 27, 2024","Is there an easy way to watch entire games from last season? 

CenterIce used to offer that, but now that I have ESPN+ it doesn't look like they are still available beyond some of the later playoff rounds. I was hoping to see some games to get deeper sense of guys on the bottom half of the Preds roster. I watched highlights but they were basically just Josi, Forsberg, or Saros, all of which I already knew were studs."
"Armourboy","Aug 27, 2024","Probably not. Bally sure isn't offering anything extra and they have the local rights."
"maplepred","Aug 27, 2024","Skjei Josi
Lauzon Fabbro
Stastney Carrier
Schenn
Del gaizo

For sure Gaizo gets sent down which is a bummer because he takes away valuable top pairing mins in Milwaukee from guys like Wilsby, Ufko and Matier. I personally think DG is a tweener and not really even worth keeping around. We have lots of D but that’s just me."
"glenngineer","Aug 27, 2024","I can't help but shake this bad feeling I've had in my head since we unloaded Askarov about so many things.

Maybe I'd get more excited if I felt some of the kid forwards had a legitimate shot at making the roster while making an impact. I like our top 8 forwards. Fil is the best of the bunch. I don't think any of them outside of Fil is elite. This causes me a lot of trepidation about who's filling slots 9-12 because the way I see it now, I don't know how you go on a deep run with the guys who are currently penciled into slots 10-12. Maybe I'll be surprised by the staff and some players who come to camp hungry and earn their spots on the roster. 

While I was truly excited on July 1, the more I've thought about this, the more nervous I've become. I wish it weren't the case. I may need to step away for a couple of weeks and let camp play out the way it's going to and see where we're at then."

"Armourboy","Aug 28, 2024","1. Probably won't, but Trotz had two choices, take a shot while he still had years with Forsberg and Josi, or sit in the middle of the pack as a bubble team because those guys would have kept us just good enough not to really bottom out.

2. No we didn't, but if you don't you may not have gotten the UFA's you did to take the shot Trotz is trying too. The minute Trotz made the decision to go all in he didn't have much choice imo.

3. Yes and no. We have no idea what he was seeing offer wise for Saros, but based on what some other guys got traded for it appears it probably wouldn't have even been what we got out of Askarov.

Basically Trotz kicked the can down the road 3 years or so, which isn't a bad thing. It lets him work in a few of the young guys, move them or keep them while the bulk should be ready to go just about the time these guys are done. I mean worse comes to worse they all get hurt and we get a top 5 draft spot, odds are though we probably just end up where we would have been anyways, squarely in the middle."
"herzausstein","Aug 28, 2024","This is a pretty decent write up though i think they underestimate a few players. Ultimately, we have a large collection of nice middle 6 and bottom 4 players but not really anyone that you can confidently point to and say they are going to be a top line /top pair player which i feel is a pretty fair assessment. We will see how things look next year. I think a few players are primed to take that next step and get into that category but it is ultimately up to them to take it."
"Predsanddead24","Aug 28, 2024","I’ll also add that in addition to all this he’s built up the prospect pool in the meantime. Askarov is really the only asset we’ve lost through this whole process which definitely stings but as a whole we’ve built up a pretty solid base of a prospect pool. That should help us be able to rebuild quicker in 4-5 years when all the current vets are gone."
"Scoresberg","Aug 28, 2024","Thanks for this. As opposed to Pronman's repulsive list, this was actually very well-written and pretty close to the truth.

People need to realize over here that our prospect pool is not that strong. It's deep - like we all know - but in terms of game-breaking talent (which you need to acquire through the draft) is hard to come by.

Now, the more you add those ""lottery tickets"" the more the odds rise that at least one of those players will outplay their draft position. But until that happens, it's all just speculation and guessing game.

Now, where it could all change is next year. Next summer's draft class is supposed be a strong one and we have three coupons to the main event."
"","Aug 28, 2024","If it goes well there won't be a ""rebuild""
We have enough good young prospects that should feed into the lineup one or two a year and then gradually move up in responsibility. Supplement that with timely UFA or trade acquisitions and we really shouldn't have to go through a teardown type rebuild phase"
"Predsanddead24","Aug 28, 2024","I enjoy prospect discussions and all but I really think the idea that any of these prospects list is close to the ""truth"" is nonsense. If you go look at say the 2021 prospect rankings Farrance was almost universally our top D prospect and Stastney was somewhere way down the list. Likewise, Evangelista is typically somewhere way down the list. I just don't think any of these online prospect people are actually any more accurate than us just crowdsourcing our rankings. If any of these media prospects experts were actually that good they'd be on an NHL scouting staff."
"","Aug 28, 2024","This. I would add that with prospect writers like Pronman, there is basically no way he can accurately rank draft prospects and organizational pipeline rankings like this and produce 32 lists where he is truly providing insight. As fans, we would have a hard time doing rankings like this of every team, but the board lists are probably for most teams a better projection than what he does because many folks here really are more familiar with their own teams prospects than he or Wheeler or any of the other guys who try to do it all."
"herzausstein","Aug 28, 2024","Prospects lists are a year by year adventure. Next season guys like Kemell, L'Heureux, Svechkov, Edstrom, and Surin could rocket rocket in potential, stand pat, or plummet. A good 60+ point season for the AHL prospects and theyll start looking more like top line potential. A big year overseas Surin and edstrom could spell the same. 

Likewise, players can stagnate or regress. Development isnt linear. We have seen top draft picks flop spectacularly while 7th rounders or even undrafted players become great NHL players. Right now we look like we got a deep prospect pool just noone looks like that certified top end talent. Some players may take that step in development this year and turn into that prospect."

"Scoresberg","Aug 29, 2024","So what are we looking at on opening night? 

Forsberg - O'Reilly - Nyquist
Stamkos - Novak - Marchessault
Jankowski - Pärssinen - Evangelista
Smith - Sissons - Tomasino
McCarron

Josi - Fabbro
Skjei - Carrier
Lauzon - Schenn
Statsney

Few talking points:

I do think that Novak gets the first crack at 2C although Pärssinen will definitely make a run for it as well. 

I would like to see the veterans maybe spread out more and add a guy like L'Heureux to that lineup at least just for the start of the year. So for the top-nine something like this:

Forsberg - O'Reilly - Evangelista
Stamkos - Pärssinen - Marchessault
L'Heureux - Novak - Nyquist

I do believe they really liked having Jankowski out there so I have him pretty much as a ""lock"" in the lineup. 

The defense is also pretty much set in stone. It would be uncharacteristic for the organization to already bring up Molendyk and I don't think they'll use both Statsney and Del Gaizo."
"Armourboy","Aug 29, 2024","Honestly didn't really have time to go into the depth I wanted, basically did it on breaks at work.

Ultimately I'm not worried because without any of these moves this team would have been a bubble team at best, and basically picking 9 or 10 in the draft at worst. And it would have stayed that way for the next 3-4 seasons as Forsberg and Josi went down and the younger players came up. Now we have a shot at least at some form of post season run for the next couple of years.

For the future in the 3 years after that you should start seeing a swing out of older players as the new come in, and if Trotz has done half decent at picking and developing the drop off should be minimal.

As long as Trotz doesn't do something silly, like selling all of our assets to try and push over the next couple of years, we are going to be in a very rare position for most playoff teams. We should basically roll from an old roster into a young one without all of the pain that usually comes along with it. In theory Saros should be the anchor that can kind of help that transition. I say theory because I have my strong doubts he is going to be a Rinne and play well into his late 30's."
"ShagDaddy","Aug 29, 2024","One of two things has to be true in my opinion. 1. The NHL scouts are very good at assessing the talents of young kids abilities and the organizations are bad at player development or 2. The NHL scouts aren’t very good at assessing young kids abilities and organizations do the best they can developing whatever players the scouts recommend. 

Personally I think the NHL draft process is very flawed compared to other professional leagues. The NFL basically has a development league that has always masqueraded under the title of the NCAA. They draft nearly full grown men that are 21-22 years old and are fully ready to compete in the NFL. The MLB does allow younger kids to be drafted but they also have A, AA and AAA farm teams that are run specifically to develop players they draft in their system. The NHL is basically watching 15-18 year old kids to evaluate them, drafting them and then leaving there development up to some junior hockey team in Canada, some college coach or some coach in Europe all of which have other priorities than developing the players that some NHL team drafted. Yes the NHL has the AHL for development but the asinine relationship policies regarding junior players going to the AHL force teams to not have say in their development until they’re 20 and already behind the development curve. The whole situation with the NHL draft eligibility and player development is just screwed up and isn’t very logical. Either raise the age of eligibility for players or use the ECHL and AHL in the same manner that the MLB uses A, AA, and AAA farm teams."
"Armourboy","Aug 29, 2024","NHL is encumbered by its agreement with the CHL, and I don't see that going anywhere. It's also a far more international based league than the NFL. MLB has some of it, but not to the same extent. 

Those other leagues don't have the concerns of an entire other country to worry about like the NHL does with Canada."
"glenngineer","Aug 29, 2024","Yet other teams are able to draft and/or develop players better than we can up front. 

For the longest time, we were considered D university. Were we though? We drafted and developed some mighty fine D yet I think the number of D that had decent careers with us or with other teams was probably around 7 or 8. Maybe it’s 10ish because I did get to 8 in my head."
"Kat Predator","Aug 29, 2024","True. Baseball may draft kids out of high school. They have the option of going to college. They have the option of playing in the minor leagues. They have the option of playing in leagues in other countries. Seems a distinction without a real difference.

The NFL is the exception as they have had longstanding agreements with college football (which is a big revenue machine in its own right) on when they can draft players. We basically saw a wink-nod-nudge trust operating between the NCAA and NFL to corner the market, which has historically been the US."
"","Aug 29, 2024","Had decent careers? So guys like Skrsstins and Klein are included? Franson? Would Zannon qualify? 

Kimmo was expansion draft acquisition but was developed here does he count? Or is it just guys like 
Hamhuis
Suter
Weber
Jones
Ellis 
Ekholm 
Josi?"
"glenngineer","Aug 30, 2024","I included Klein and Skrastins. Franson is debatable. Funny thing is, who have we drafted in the last 10 years that amounted to anything on the blue line? Early on, we identified and hit on a bunch of d, not so much lately. 

With all that said, we’ve drafted 3 elite d-men, 2 goalies who were borderline elite and no forwards who were. That’s not a recipe for Cup success."
"Kat Predator","Aug 30, 2024","On the bright side, we're now on the Vegas path of building through free agency and trading away prospects, so horrible drafting and lousy player development isn't important."
"glenngineer","Aug 30, 2024","I sure hope so. Florida had three guys on their roster that they drafted so it’s proven to work."
"","Aug 30, 2024","I think we stopped investing in the blue line as much. We’ll see in Molendyk."
"Armourboy","Aug 30, 2024","That's the big key. I mean we had long term solutions in Josi, Ellis, and Ekholm plus several youngsters we were waiting on with Fabbro, Carrier, etc. What we needed were forwards. Too bad in one of the better drafts for them Poile went and drafted a goalie."
"Gh24","Aug 30, 2024","You don't need to draft another Josi every year. If we manage to have one every ten years or so we should be fine. Add few ""ekky's"" and ""ellis'"" here and there with a bunch of reliable bottom pair guys and we're good.

It would be great to have a star forward once in a while, but how often does anyone find gems with similar picks to ours? And whoever you happen to point out I don't think we have ever been the only ones to pass those guys. Who knows, maybe one of our current prospects grow into much better hockey players than we're expecting."
"Porter Stoutheart","Sep 3, 2024","When do Parssinen, Tomasino, and Del Gaizo finally cave in? It's September now, rookie camp starts in 8 days, the 11th, and main camp a week later on the 18th.

What do you think is the holdup? 

I can't really see asking for much. He can only get a 2-way contract, and his NHL salary can't be any higher than the league minimum. I don't think he could have even really come to the team and asked for as much as what Stastney got in arbitration. I don't see how he could ask for more than, say, a 2-way deal at $775k/$350k... if there is any sticking point, it has to be in the weeds of his AHL salary... Gravel is getting $300k, Blankenburg $350k, Stastney $400k... somewhere in that ballpark shouldn't result in any significant delay? 

 also shouldn't be THAT tough to figure out. I would assume he's basically a lock for the main roster, they aren't going to waive him. So I don't see any reason why the Preds would insist on a 2-way contract for him? If you assume he has to get a 1-way, then the sticking point is only $$$? Somewhere from $775k to $1M? Given his demotion last season, I don't see the argument for more than the $775k. Parssinen should have taken that long ago and continued building goodwill with the organization. If he's asking for more $$$, he's nuts. He should just get in there and play hard for a nice contract next year. Just because the team has a little Cap space now after moving Glass, it doesn't mean he should expect any bigger payday today.

Whereas I can see  being a little more prickly about things. He may optimally prefer to play somewhere else. He has put up decent enough production that he could ask for a little more $$$ than the league minimum, while at the same time, I'm sure the Preds don't see him as a sure bet for the lineup. The team might not mind waiving him, while at the same time Tomasino would probably not mind being waived and getting a chance elsewhere. So even though I can see the two sides not seeing eye-to-eye, I think it ultimately has to be in Tomasino's best interest to just take whatever contract the Preds are offering, even if it's league minimum or 2-way... then if he gets waived just go somewhere else and play and try to earn a better contract next summer."
"Ben Grimm","Sep 3, 2024","I've seen every Preds season and this is the first time they've got both enough offense and talent to win the SC. This is our year."
"wmupreds","Sep 3, 2024","Maybe. They're also quite old and banking on a lot of lack of decline/staying healthy to get to that level. I've said all along I like what Trotz did this offseason but it's not that hard to imagine it going a little sideways."
"glenngineer","Sep 3, 2024","We're also one injury to Saros being FUBAR. While Askarov was an unknown, he had the pedigree to step in and hold the fort. I have no faith in Wedgewood and whoever our number three is currently to do so."
"","Sep 3, 2024","Wedgewood did it in Dallas last year. He actually outplayed Oettiger for good part of the season. He's certainly a safer bet to do so THIS year than Askarov. He's not a longterm starter, but he is perfectly capable to step in if Saros goes down."
"Ben Grimm","Wednesday at 8:00 AM","You may be right. I turned 62 Saturday (still got a full head of brown hair though  ) and may be an old man seeing the glass half full. As for our defense, Weber hit others and the puck hard but that was about it and some question his HHoF credentials. I prefer Josi's all-around game to win a SC. Our goalies are solid also."
"Armourboy","Wednesday at 8:42 AM","Yeah we have the opposite of last years season, where I think the only injury we had for more than a couple of days was Novak, and we could find ourselves going from one of the oldest rosters in the league to one of the youngest, and be picking 8th instead of going to the playoffs."
"","Wednesday at 11:29 AM","I think Weber did more than that. He was a physical defensive defenseman with decent speed, extremely strong on the boards and in front of the net (as much as you can be now), he was also a huge threat to score from the blueline.
Josi's defensive game relies on retrivials and skating it out of danager (possession). You need both."
"Ben Grimm","Wednesday at 11:53 AM","He and Saros are both top 5. I like our team. This is our SC year."
"herzausstein","Wednesday at 12:21 PM","Rookie camp starts in a week.... the dead time is almost over!"
"nullednumbed","Wednesday at 1:06 PM","Yep. I just can't see all these guys having career years again. Age will catch up; it is undefeated. So I suppose I am in the minority that I am more pessimistic than most about this season. I just see issues with the 2C. I don't believe much in Novak and I think moving Stamkos over is a bad idea. Also not a fan of seeing Evangelista most likely end up on the 3rd line. That being said I am pumped to see Steven freaking Stamkos as a Pred and hope this squad proves me wrong."
"","Wednesday at 3:54 PM","I like it! LFG!"
"maplepred","Wednesday at 4:12 PM","I hope you’re right. I said that when we had easily the best defense in the league with guys like Weber, Suter, hamhuis, Klein, timonen, dislike etc plus an offense consisting of kariya, Peter Forsberg, hartnell, arnott, Sullivan, erat, dumont, radulov, legwand etc
That’s insane talent and depth with a stud goalie in net. 

Never count your chickens before they hatch. I hope you’re right though"
"weeze","Thursday at 12:04 PM","Don't good/great players seem to have career years in bunches or a lot. A single good year does not make a great player. Put great players with great players and they seem to feed off of each other. Especially if they get along and like each other."
"Predsanddead24","Thursday at 1:33 PM","Nyquist is really the only one who had a true outlier career year for us last season. Forsberg has had similar seasons in the past. O'Reilly has as well but did return to form after a down 22-23. Marchessault did have a career goal scoring career but even if he's just a 25G-30A type guy that is still a huge improvement over our rotating cast of second line wingers last year. Then you're adding Stamkos into the mix as an upgrade too. Saros also had a down year last season too and is primed for a bounceback with Korn as well. Hitting the age cliff is definitely concern but I don't think we are reliant on anyone having huge outlier types of seasons."
"herzausstein","Thursday at 3:21 PM","On paper, we are better off than at the start of last season even if Stamkos and the older crew drop off some. 

Stamkos, Marchessault are better than any of the forwards we lost. 

Skjei is as good or better than McDonagh and the rest of the defense is basically the same. 

Saros is still saros and Wedgewood is basically the same as Lankinen. 

If we can also get incremental gains from the young players like Novak, Evangelista, Parssinen, and Tomasino, then this should be a pretty good season even with regression from Nyquist. 

Who do we think will be the PK forwards?
Sissons, McCarron, Smith, RoR, and maybe Parssinen. Jankowski if he is on the roster as well. 

Novak, Stamkos, Marchessault, Evangelista, Tomasino, and Forsberg werent used on the PK last season. Nyquist would get tagged in occasionally. This is something that may play into lineup decisions in the long run. 

For defense: Skjei, Lauzon, Carrier, and Schenn. Fabbro if he is playing is also a choice."
"Porter Stoutheart","Thursday at 3:53 PM","I feel like last year we overall ""overachieved"" relative to most predictions/odds? Now, I'm not saying the various ""pundits"" or oddsmakers are really All That, they get things wrong pretty close to as much as right. Still, I don't think a 47-30-5/99pts/playoff berth season was really the median prognostication for us. We ""overachieved"" to the tune of a Jack Adams nomination for Brunette. 

So I don't know what the encore is. We could certainly get better goaltending from Saros, which might be the biggest improvement of all. I haven't looked at predictions sites yet for the coming season. In my mind, I think a wildcard prediction should be ""safer"" than last season, when it was equal odds with a lottery pick? Can we be even better and rise into contention? Still seems doubtful to me. 

But once you balance up all the myriad factors, I'd be truly disappointed if we didn't make the playoffs in the coming season. Whereas last season, I thought it would have been fair to miss, and it wouldn't have alarmed or disappointed me if we had come up short. I'm still not expecting to guarantee a playoff round win or anything. But if everything goes right..."
"Predsanddead24","Thursday at 4:27 PM","Personally, my expectations are to at least win a playoff round. Missing the playoffs would be a huge failure and I'm pretty much over the moral victory of being a tough out in the first round. 
It doesn't really concern me much whether we make the playoffs as a wild card or in a divisional slot. Given how dramatically the roster has changed I wouldn't be surprised if we have a slow start but hopefully we can hit our stride at the right time like we did in 16-17."
"wmupreds","Thursday at 4:54 PM","Usually part of the deal with going all in would be an expectation to truly contend for hardware. So through that lens anything short of at least winning a playoff series is a disappointment.

The caveat here if we're evaluating Trotz is that usually going all in involves giving up futures to do so. Trotz hasn't really done that, so I'm willing to give some leeway on the short term on ice results."
"Porter Stoutheart","Friday at 8:38 AM","Yeah if we get some extra Cap at some point from the Johansen situation and then Trotz starts using some of our extra 1sts or better prospects to fill that Cap in with deadline rentals then that would more strongly signal going “all in”.

I’m not sure what to hope for on that front, actually. I guess I’m conditioned by some of Poile’s “all in” deadline acquisitions, and I’m not interested in giving up 1sts or top youngsters for the next Gaustad or Simmonds. But flip side of course I want the team to be good enough to be labeled as “buyers” (/contenders). I just hope Trotz doesn’t get too carried away on that front too soon."
"weeze","Friday at 9:23 AM","Well we did have a 18 game point streak so that did help. Without that or if we played to what our avg was then we don't make the PO's.

Naturally, they talked about the Askarov trade and how he wanted to see the path to starter which he didn't see in Nashville after the Saros extension. Friedman did mention about the Devils interest on him but that they had already acquired Markstrom + they had Allen, so Askarov didn't see as clear a path to starter there than he did in San Jose. Found it odd as Markstrom and Allen are both 34. I guess Askarov really wanted them to hand him the starter role without any waiting or competition, lol.

Friedman also touched on the Pärssinen & Tomasino extensions which are being ""grinded daily"" at this point. Don't really know what grinding there is to do with these deals.. but good to hear that the negotiations are ongoing."

To me, the fact that you'd lose him on waivers 100% for certain if you tried to send him down says to me there's absolutely no point whatsoever in bothering with a 2-way deal for him. I'm not sure Trotz looks at things quite that way, however?"

"Predsanddead24","Yesterday at 3:23 PM","Could also be that rookie camp starts in a two days and he's telling these guys this is his best offer so take it or leave it because he's moving on to the season now. Not like any of these guys have any leverage at all."
"herzausstein","Yesterday at 3:45 PM","Just under 1.5 million in capspace and Del Gaizo in the minors and a 21 man roster. Really not a way to get to 23 man roster and be cap compliant since league min is 775K (i think) without sending down someone like McCarron (900K or more). That would free up space for 3 league min contracts and be cap compliant. More than likely we run a 22 player roster and accumulate some space over the year for a deadline pickup if needed. 

Tomasino at whatever he cost will put us up to 13 forwards. 1 of stastney, Molendyk, or del gaizo puts us at 7 d, then 2 goalies. Should have roughly 500K to 700K in space depending on how things shake out (22 players)"
"","Yesterday at 4:42 PM","Are we factoring in Johansen or no?"
"wmupreds","Yesterday at 5:57 PM","For those of you saying Parssinen is better or will be better than Tomasino. I get it. There are legitimate eye test reasons to think so. But it's worth noting that he was absolutely awful at NHL level last year, and while Brunette took some blame, it's on the player too."
"Armourboy","Yesterday at 6:11 PM","Brunette takes the blame because he didn't put him in a position where he could do well. He was on a different line every night, and the role he was asked to play was different every night. Coaches don't publicly take the blame on players, so for him to do so tells you something.

For what its worth, I don't think Tomasino has been put in the best of situations either."
"Predsanddead24","Yesterday at 7:19 PM","Yeah there’s plenty to like about Parsinnen but I do find it interesting how the general consensus on here is much higher on him than Tomasino."
"BigFatCat999","Yesterday at 7:37 PM","Anybody else wondering if there’s a trade Fabbro. they’re always seems to be smoke with him being traded"
"Predsanddead24","Yesterday at 7:45 PM","Seems like that ship has kind of sailed at this point. If there were a decent return out there for him we probably move him instead of Glass. No reason to move him and at worst he’s a nice depth piece that we know can play well with Josi."
"Porter Stoutheart","Yesterday at 8:54 PM","I think that’s more situational/pragmatic though than based on any sort of objective player evaluation? I see Parssinen as a player the Preds will at least afford an opportunity to. I’m not so sure they will afford the same opportunity to Tomasino. It’s independent of being “higher” on one than the other."
"maplepred","Yesterday at 10:14 PM","We will regret letting Tomasino go if that happens. The dude is a good hockey player I don’t get why anyone has issues with him. Give the kid a one way deal and get him out on the ice. He should have been full time last season. Ridiculous they are screwing around with this."
"Armourboy","Yesterday at 10:34 PM","I think Fabbro is still here because he provides an option if someone goes down long term. He's basically depth, or who knows, after last season Trotz may be more than a little worried that Schenn just completely drops off.

Either way the depth option he provides is worth more than the draft pick you could get. The only reason to move him is if someone gives you something that fills a hole you don't know you currently have."
"Porter Stoutheart","Today at 12:24 AM","Now just Tomasino left... if he holds out, it will be interesting to see who would land the final roster spot. It could be L'Heureux or they might just use one of the AHL tweeners they signed like Lucchini. It sort of has to be a 22-man roster now, unless we do get cashback for RyJo. The Cap remaining is less than the league minimum salary.

"","Today at 12:41 AM","Parssinen wasn't given a chance to play center until he had already been run down the line up at wing then sat for two weeks. 

The ""the coaches ruined Tomasino"" thing is tired, he hasn't shown anything except being able to put up .5 ppg in sheltered minutes against grinders. He at least played his normal position and was given top6 minutes and PP time.

Let Parssinen work his way into the lineup in the position he knows then see where the chips fall. If he succeeds, great. If he performs at Tomasino's level then give someone else a chace. If they play him at wing again, expect the same result."
"Gh24","Today at 4:05 AM","Any chance they were just waiting out to see if there was extra capspace coming from Joey's contract termination in time?

Parssinen and Del Gaizo didn't have much leverage, so they were probably easy to persuade to just take the minimum deals if there was no extra capspace just to make it work.

Tomasino had good point totals for last few years, so there's some leverage, so he might be a tougher customer. Barry may have promised a compensation for taking less money now, but it's always a risk."
"Scoresberg","Today at 5:23 AM","I know you were trying to diss Tomasino, but having a 0.5 PPG player in your 4th line is pretty f***ing good, imo. Especially for a team struggling with depth scoring. At least a lot better than some of the guys we're throwing out there night in night out."
"","Today at 7:24 AM","Contract hasn't been voided officially yet and there will be a grievance so no, we can't count that cap space, probably not for a while"
"Porter Stoutheart","Today at 7:44 AM","The thing that worries me most about Tomasino is that he didn't exactly dominate offensively in Milwaukee. Well, I didn't watch the games, so maybe he was flying around out there and looking great every night, I don't really know, but I didn't get that sense from the Milwaukee observers? 18pts in 22 games is pretty good, and IIRC he tended to have more shots than most players, 67 shots in 22 games is a pretty good rate indicating offensive involvement. But then the playoffs... just 6 points in 15 games, which was 9th on the team. And the same sort of thing happened the previous season in the playoffs too, when had just 9 points in 16 games, 7th on the team.

I guess I would expect if he's really going to be a top-6 NHL winger with scoring potential, he should be pretty dominant by now at the AHL level? Whereas it seems like, particularly when the going gets a little tougher in the playoffs, he sort of vanishes into the crowd a bit? He's still good at that level... but so is Rocco Grimaldi.

Last couple of seasons we still had some gaping openings for scoring positions, so I didn't think there was any harm taking a look at him in the Preds lineup, also considering we were in a ""retooling"" sort of phase. But now... with extra scoring veterans added, with more of a ""competitive"" mindset, with other rookies making stronger pushes... I'm not sure there's going to be room. Our top 3 playoff scorers in Milwaukee were L'Heureux, Kemell, and Svechkov, not Tomasino. Heck, we let Afanaseyev walk away for nothing and he was ahead of Tomasino down there too.

Maybe he's a little pissed that the organization isn't giving him too much of a chance and isn't really fired up to be playing in Milwaukee? But in a way, that'd just be another strike against him, right?"
"Predsanddead24","Today at 7:58 AM","He put up points at the fifth highest rate on the team last season. I know scoring isn’t everything but I just still can’t understand why Tomasino became the whipping boy."
"","Today at 8:01 AM","Sure, but, if he's really as good as people think then he should have been getting more points against the tweeners and grinders. His performance when pushed into top 6 and PP minutes was negligible, just like his performance in the AHL playoffs. There really is a theme here if you're willing to see it.

That said, I'm not against giving the kid a chance. I just don't see how he has any leverage to expect anything other then a minimum contract. Maybe his expectation of more is a signal to his issue against stiffer competition. Wanting and being will to put in the work are two different things.

And, I'm not going to expect miracles if/when he does get a chance."
"Armourboy","Today at 8:33 AM","Sadly I think this is just one of those cases where he is putting up points, but he's not doing it the "" right way "". He will likely end up being another of those guys that eventually goes and plays for someone else and has a pretty solid career."
"Porter Stoutheart","Today at 8:53 AM","I'm just not sure where Tomasino would even fit into the current lineup? I guess you put him on the 4th line with McCarron again, and Jankowski in the pressbox? Then he hangs around being a candidate to slide up into more of a scoring role in the event of injury to one of our veteran wingers?

It's an option, but I'm not too optimistic that it will show us anything new about Tomasino. I guess if you argue he can be a soft 0.5 ppg player in that role, as he basically has so far in his career, that's not anything terrible. But it will always leave us begging the question of what he could do with a more involved role, and why he doesn't get one. And probably leave him wondering too. 

I imagine he just wants out of Dodge at this point. And if I was in his camp, I think the surest way to get there is to just sign the contract, play hard, get noticed enough by another team that I either make it worth the Preds while to trade me for a pick, or worth some other team's notice to pick me up on waivers. He shouldn't be looking at this season as a chance to earn money. This is his chance to go somewhere else to try to make money somewhere else in future years."
"","Today at 8:55 AM","Tomasinos problem is he didn't go down and torch the AHL like someone who belongs in the NHL should have. I was a fan, but I suspect he's gonna wash out of here and bounce around as a lifetime tweener"
"Softball99","Today at 9:08 AM","4th liners get minimum contracts, since he's only productive w/ Big Sexy it's unrealistic to expect anything else. How are Fiala and Tolvanen comparable? Toatlly different reasons for departure."
"Porter Stoutheart","Today at 9:51 AM","Well I'm not sure Tolvanen is that different? To me he looked good with us, looked like maybe he was deserving of more opportunity, and yet was not afforded that opportunity, waived, lost. Which to me seems like a legitimate possibility to be the same path that Tomasino ends up following?

The main difference might be that I also thought Tolvanen worked very diligently at becoming a well-rounded player, at learning to play a more complete 2-way game, to attempt to add a physical element to his game. He seemed to be doing exactly what the organization was asking of him, and yet was still cast aside. I'm not sure I've seen any such signs of Tomasino adapting his playing style. 

Fiala is of course a totally different case."
"Predsanddead24","53 minutes ago","He produced points at a higher rate than anyone except for the first line and Novak last season and produced this highest rates in the few times he got ice time with other skill players. His PP performance was underwhelming but totally in line with what the 2nd unit did generally all season. The AHL performance is the biggest knock on him for sure but I think his NHL performance has been good enough I’m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. 

Ultimately I think there is plenty to criticize Tomasino for but he seems to get so much more criticism than other players. For example, while Evangelista certainly passes the eye test more strongly what exactly is the numbers argument that he is any better than Tomasino?"
"Porter Stoutheart","2 minutes ago","I am just assuming in the end it comes down to off-ice/organizational observations that us fans will never see? Statistics won't show the full story. We can only assume based on what has actually happened in terms of on-ice deployment that there is something they like about how Evangelista comports himself, vs. something they don't like correspondingly about Tomasino? 

I know it's not a scientific or satisfactory answer, but past a certain point, in our darkened room, we have to start making some kinds of assumptions about why they don't seem to like Tomasino, despite numbers that might otherwise look pretty good?"
