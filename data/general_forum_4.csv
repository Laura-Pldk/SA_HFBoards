"Coffees","Friday at 11:26 AM","Not sure who it would be on the Canucks, Elias Pettersson or Dakota Joshua I think


Okay now your guys turn, feel free to talk about upcoming two way players or unsung heros of your team as well"
"Jacob","Friday at 11:31 AM","Hmm.. I’d say Rust or Eller. Maybe a newcomer like Lizotte proves to be better."
"","Friday at 11:34 AM","Elias has been better for longer, Joshua needs to somewhat repeat what he did last season."
"","Friday at 11:35 AM","On the Avs, probably not suspended Nuke, or uninjured Lehkonen, or not LTIR'd Landeskog. Fun times lol."
"","Friday at 11:37 AM",""
"Nicko999","Friday at 11:39 AM","Suzuki"
"Coffees","Friday at 12:03 PM","That's the big question with Joshua. Also, are we in a somewhat agreement for the first time ever?"
"The90","Friday at 12:04 PM","Max Domi"
"HugeInTheShire","Friday at 12:04 PM","Devils are easy, it's Nico Hischier"
"5 Hole","Friday at 12:08 PM","I'm gonna go with Barkov."
"Choralone","Friday at 12:09 PM","Kopitar and Danault, still."
"Coffees","Friday at 12:10 PM","I love that player"
"Idiot Stick","Friday at 12:10 PM","cant think of one"
"LeafsNation149","Friday at 12:11 PM","Matthews"
"VanIsle","Friday at 12:15 PM","Marchand"
"","Friday at 12:18 PM","No."
"OgeeOgelthorpe","Friday at 12:23 PM","Compher, Copp and Rasmussen are all pretty close in Detroit. Which is the problem."
"Stive Morgan","Friday at 12:24 PM","Suzuki, but his defense on the PK is overrated and his defense at even-strength is rated.

I've always felt and observed that his game (specifically defensive game) works better with the speed, constant transitioning, and unpredictability of 5-on-5 or 4-on-4, vs. set plays/strategies on the PK. Suzuki is often at his best while thinking on his toes."
"BagHead","Friday at 12:28 PM","Easy one, . How this guy has never been a finalist for the Selke, I do not know. He battles for literally every inch of ice, all over the ice, and usually wins. He's got a good stick, good positioning, strong body, he's physical, and he even scores most of his goals for the same reasons that he's good defensively, he's just .
There are three things I will never stop singing the virtues of: my family, Costco, and Joel Eriksson Ek. I know about it, and you need to know it too.

Behind him there's a cast of decent defensive guys, but none that are as complete. Guys who deserve a little credit are Ryan Hartman, Marcus Foligno, and (until last year) Freddy Gaudreau. I think Marco Rossi is going to get there, too, but he wasn't there yet."
"","Friday at 12:30 PM","Sean Couturier is still the top dog in Philly."
"Vinh","Friday at 12:35 PM","Should have been a Selke finalist last year. He's annoying as hell to play against."
"I am not exposed","Friday at 12:42 PM","Barkov"
"MessierII","Friday at 12:47 PM","Probably Nugent Hopkins. Connor Brown is really good too but plays way less minutes."
"Artemi Panarin","Friday at 12:52 PM",""
"Sheppy","Friday at 12:54 PM","Marchand.

Bruins have been lucky with he and Bergeron."
"MessierII","Friday at 12:54 PM","What’s funny? Brown is unbelievable away from the puck. If he wasn’t he would have been waived this year."
"Mrb1p","Friday at 12:55 PM","Suzuki easy"
"Coffees","Friday at 12:57 PM","How far behind is McDavid now from RNH? in terms of defensive awareness. I know McDavid has been good defensively this year


You can't blame that Rangers fan, your own team board turned Brown into a meme last year even though he was not terrible."
"ESH","Friday at 12:58 PM","Mikael Backlund has quietly been one of the best defensive forwards in the league for a decade now"
"WhataKnight","Friday at 1:00 PM","Knight’s don’t make this one easy.

Depending on health and what day of the week it is, this could be Karlsson, Eichel, Stone OR Roy."
"MessierII","Friday at 1:03 PM","McDavid has always been solid his biggest issue has always been flying the zone early to cheat for offense. It forces our D to make tougher plays than they should have to. This is especially prevalent when they him and Draisaitl together. Drai and him together are a defensive disaster but when they are clicking the offense more than makes up for it. When separated they both play solid D but neither are as polished as Nuge."
"","Friday at 1:04 PM","Nic Dowd maybe. Could end up being Lapierre."
"Coffees","Friday at 1:05 PM","Appreciate the insight, Mess.

Also, care to address the Connor Brown statement ?"
"Soundgarden","Friday at 1:06 PM","O'Reilly or Sissons."
"Coffees","Friday at 1:06 PM","Don't think Protas will take the next step? Lol that dude is the most underrated U23 Center in the game


Puck pursuit : O'Reilly
Covering passing lanes : Sissons

correct or wrong ?"
"Pavel Buchnevich","Friday at 1:17 PM","Trocheck for the Rangers.

Will Cuylle was great defensively for a rookie and a non elite rookie on the defensive end. He’ll be a stud defensive forward in another few years."
"RickyLafleur","Friday at 1:22 PM","He was also one of, if not the best defensive forward in Ottawa before he was traded."
"","Friday at 1:24 PM","I actually almost included Protas in my post. 

So yeah put him in the conversation."
"Coffees","Friday at 1:25 PM","San Jose will take him for a slight overpayment in picks"
"Aladyyn","Friday at 2:07 PM","We have a lot of turnover in the bottom 6 but of players that were on the team last year and still are this year, it might just be Zach Benson. Either him or Greenway."
"behemolari","Saturday at 7:38 PM","Barkov.. I guess"
"Naster Okan","Saturday at 7:51 PM","Jason Dickinson"
"Kevin27NYI","Saturday at 7:54 PM","Pageau for me, cizikas is close second."
"The Devilish Buffoon","Saturday at 7:56 PM","I have high hopes for Nikolai Kulemin, personally. 


If someone only watched hockey from October 2023 - March 2024, they might actually believe you know a thing or two."
"Hank Chinaski","Saturday at 8:06 PM","Jets: Iafallo or Lowry. HM to Niederreiter."
"Macheteops","Saturday at 8:56 PM","McDavid is better at attacking the player with the puck

He tends to lose his man some when his guy doesn't have the puck in their own zone"
"Nick Lang","Saturday at 9:50 PM","Blueger or Miller for me as a Canucks fan. I can't actually believe I said Miller. Huge turnaround from 3-4 years ago."
"MessierII","Yesterday at 11:04 AM","What can I say? Brown is really good defensively. This is a guy who didn’t score a single goal until the 65th game of the season on a team with cup aspirations. He wasn’t kept around for his secondary scoring lol. Hes a tenacious checker and smart player. Great defensive stick and knows when to pressure guys. Henrique and Janmark are strong defensive guys too but brown to me was the anchor on that line and his PK work is unbelievable as well."
"Muffinalt","Yesterday at 11:10 AM","About the only one we have too..."
"FerrisRox","Yesterday at 11:29 AM","What's with the gif?

Connor Brown was outstanding defensively for the Oilers, and was really good with the Senators before that too.

He plays a very tenacious style and is excellent positionally without the puck."
"Roo","Yesterday at 11:50 AM","I would say kampf for the leafs."
"piqued","Yesterday at 11:56 AM","Hintz"
"","Yesterday at 12:23 PM","Compher or Copp"
"tarheelhockey","Yesterday at 12:31 PM","In terms of pure matchup defense, Jordan Staal. 

Seth Jarvis has a pretty good case in terms of chaotic disruption of the other team."
"KirkAlbuquerque","Yesterday at 12:51 PM","Probably Zibanejad . His advanced stats don’t really stand out but that’s because I feel like defensive metrics are heavily weighted by possession and he’s an awful possession player but he’s a good defender, works hard in the defensive zone and makes good defensive plays all the time"
"norrisnick","Yesterday at 12:56 PM","Can't wait for one of the kids to be 2C so those two can combine with Ras as a real pain in the ass matchup line."
"","Yesterday at 1:06 PM","IMO its Marner"
"Roo","Yesterday at 1:09 PM","Considered him for sure, but went with kampf bc he is so important on defensive faceoffs. Just my opinion, but I feel like anyone in the ‘best defensive forward’ category needs to be a centre given the responsibility of the position. But yeah, Marner is probably next on my list."
"Fatass","Yesterday at 1:10 PM","Habs aren’t “my” team (hate them actually) but really like Suzuki. IMO he’s a fabulous player, especially without the puck. He’s up there with the best defensively sound forwards in the league.


For sure it’s MM. he’s a Selke level forward."
"Kingfan1967","Yesterday at 1:34 PM","For LA it's still Kopitar, even at 36 he's one of the better defensive centers. Byfield is underrated too. (it's what LA as a team encourages)."
"Magic Mittens","Yesterday at 3:02 PM","Hintz, and then Johnston and Steel"
"kcunac","Yesterday at 3:06 PM","2 years ago maybe. Now it’s JT Miller. He’s the one always getting the tough matchups."
"Coffees","Yesterday at 3:15 PM","Yeah but this year it should be Pettersson getting the hard matchups


What makes Kopitar so great ?


Marner is a beast"
"HighNote","Yesterday at 3:32 PM","Blues

It's probably Buchnevich, but Thomas is right there and I'd throw Saad into the mix as well."
"Bounces R Way","Yesterday at 3:59 PM","Mikael Backlund gets some of the toughest matchups year in year out and still puts up Bergeron-like possession numbers. Coleman is pretty damn good too."
"BostonBob","Yesterday at 6:05 PM","The one Bruin player that everybody loves regardless of what team you cheer for:"
"","Yesterday at 6:10 PM","A couple of years ago I would have said Elias Lindholm. Now it's definitely Mikael Backlund."
"Coffees","Yesterday at 9:16 PM","Saad has always had excellent awareness also Thomas will be the best two way forward next year no doubt. Dudes got the right mentality


both these players are absolutely perfect for the rebuild to bring up the future Flames.

Already a great ground work for the Flames when you throw in the prospect pipeline from the backend"
"Craig Button","Yesterday at 9:59 PM","Marner AINEC"
"Fatass","Yesterday at 10:02 PM","Marner is soooo good. Crazy how some Leaf’s fans want to trade him. Stupid actually. Can rarely replace such players. Have the Habs replaced Gainy?"
"BonMorrison","Yesterday at 10:04 PM","Homie who dropped that gif about Brown got ratio’d and then never came back to the thread, eh? Love to see it."
"57special","Yesterday at 10:04 PM","That you might pick Greenway as your best defensive forward tells me why the Sabres always seem be less than the sum of their parts. I thought Cozens was decent defensively? Greenway was out of shape, lazy, and inconsistent for MN. 

For MN, it's easy. JEE all day long. Could be better on FO's... that's about it. I mean, if he had better speed he could cover McDavid and Mackinnon better, but those are two of the fastest players in the history of the game."
"Craig Button","Yesterday at 10:04 PM","Leaf fans are pretty dumb. 

Some think Wendel Clark was a good player. 

That’s says a lot"
"","Yesterday at 10:08 PM","Cirelli."
"pi314","Today at 12:39 AM","87 for the Pens"
