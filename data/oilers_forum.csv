"Mr Kot","Tuesday at 1:42 PM","Preseason coming up soon and hopefully we have a good one. Excited to see the young guns try to push their way into the lineup and maybe join the main group opening night.





Time to win cup this season"
"TB12","Tuesday at 1:47 PM","Everyone get their narratives and complaints set early!

If Knobber doesn't play the vets very much then he's an idiot and they wasted too much time on developing guys who will never make the team and the top guys didn't get a chance to mesh and gel together.

If Knobber plays the vets lots and they start the year slow (or gasp, someone gets injured) then he's an idiot for running the horses into the ground early. It's a marathon and not a sprint.

etc, etc..."
"K1984","Tuesday at 1:53 PM","Any other season ticket holders struggling with the horrendous Oilers+ free promo login?

They emailed a promo code to access free Oilers+ for the year, but naturally they don't seem to allow you to apply it to an existing account. So I made a new account, but naturally there didn't seem to be a way to apply it there either. 

Does anyone know how to work around this ridiculous system?"
"Drivesaitl","Tuesday at 1:54 PM","Last seasons slow start had little to do with the team meshing. It was the team peaking too early in training, even according to McDavid who felt fatigued and not 100% at seasons start. 

The topline this year will be identically the same. The players knowing each other in their sleep. The Drai line will need time to work together. Big changes there as well as D pairings I guess. 

Last season schedule was odd as well. We played nucks 3X early and that seemed to be their Stanley Cup beating us early in season. Also tough games Florida, Carolina, Tampa etc. 

Most of our troubled start was atrocious goaltending and coaching."
"","Tuesday at 2:02 PM","I had to email my rep to get that issue sorted out last season. Give them an email and they will send you the fix."
"The Panther","Tuesday at 2:13 PM","That's my feeling, too. There was this air about the club one year ago, like, """" Which is fine, but you can't really approach the season with that much intensity in training camp if you don't want to burn out before the playoffs. 

I think MacTavish said the mood a year ago was ""trying to win the Cup in pre-season"".

I suspect this year the big guys will get a bit less ice-time (they're getting older, too), and in the first 9-10 games or whatever it is (before NHL contracts have to be signed with young players) we'll see some of the young'uns getting a fair shot. Even if they play .500 hockey for the first 15 games, they'll still be WAY ahead of where they were a year ago at that stage...

The most fun this season, I predict, will be watching the Draisaitl line (whatever it ultimately is) taking shape. The top six (actually the top nine) looks remarkably promising, so let's hope they can all start scoring at will again... because the defence looks damn suspect."
"94 Oil Drops","Tuesday at 3:08 PM","Well have fun with the pre season peeps. I'll be visiting Quebec and a small part of New England over this pre season, celebrating my 5th wedding anniversary. It'll be nice to not think about hockey much until the regular season actually starts before I overreact and complain like the rest of you. 

I'll check the score boards ever so often and do a creep here and there in HF but I won't be watching any games. Probably wouldn't even if I wasn't on a trip anyways TBH since OEG is hiding them beyond a paywall. I just can't get invested in pre season now that the decade of darkness is over besides. Hopefully Savoie impresses. That's all I ask."
"GreeningOil","Wednesday at 6:30 PM","As an Oiler fan, I too am angry about all decisions, especially in hindsight!!"
"AM","Wednesday at 8:13 PM","Don’t steal them all."
"FlameChampion","Wednesday at 9:25 PM","I think the power play struggles were a huge part of it too. I think Woodcroft was a propped up with a historic powerplay and once it wasn’t… well"
"FlameChampion","Wednesday at 11:05 PM","Delete"
"K1984","Wednesday at 11:09 PM","For years across multiple groups of players and multiple coaches our depth players have been complete ass until about January. Every year Leon and McDavid light it up and the power play lights it up until they get burned out in December and the team goes to shit. Then the bottom of the lineup gets going and the ship rights itself. 

Difference was last year the power play and McDavid/Drai were ass to resulting in the disaster start. The key beyond all else IMO is the bottom of the roster players playing a role as soon as the season starts, not when they get chastised and the team is desperate."
"FlameChampion","Wednesday at 11:14 PM","Agreed that the bottom 6 doesn’t tend to have anything going until January. Hopefully not the case this year. If Henrique/Brown/Janmark are as good as they were in the playoffs, I’d like to see the line used as a checking line and used in some defensive and open net situations at end of the game just to get more guys going."
"Slats432","Wednesday at 3:46 PM","Correction..."
"Mr Kot","Yesterday at 11:34 AM","tomorrow is the first day!"
"bobbythebrain","Yesterday at 11:43 AM","Fire Knobby and Bowman. Their decisions are inexcusable!!

Daryl Katz needs to answer for this!!

The refs are instructed to screw us!!

Bettman doesn't want Edmonton to win!!

It's Carol Baskins fault!!"
"Fixed to Ruin","Yesterday at 11:50 AM",""
"BlackDogg","Yesterday at 11:57 AM","Why are we still playing these rookies? Practice time is wasting!! Preseason is almost over Damnit.

Bring in Jay Woodford."
"MessierII","Yesterday at 12:13 PM","There won’t be as much pressure on the bottom 6 to produce because the top 6 is absurdly stacked even without Kane."
"Lay Z Boy GM","Yesterday at 1:02 PM","I’m very pumped over here guys. Preseason is whatever. Nuge said the vets sweet spot is 3-4 games. I agree, don’t work them too much. I’d prefer the last couple games to basically be the full roster and a few hopefuls maybe get a chance in those games to prove themselves.

This is basically warmup for the elite players and a possible audition for the 4th line and RD.

I’m going to the last game so hopefully it’s 90% of the full roster and we absolutely trash the Nucks."
"Oildrum","Yesterday at 1:07 PM","Sunday is a must win, if they lose I'm out for the rest of the season and just shows how much of a terrible decision hiring Bowman was."
"Oilslick941611","Yesterday at 1:10 PM","just shows that regular seasons purpose to make the playoffs. we lost to the Canucks but beat them in the playoffs. We shouldn't be throwing too much weight on winning the regular season. Goal is the cup, goal for the season to make the playoffs comfortable and with our division that shouldn't be an issue."
"Senor Catface","Yesterday at 1:13 PM","I think we should, without irony, forbid Spawn from starting a ""Fire Bowman"" topic at any point this season."
"Lay Z Boy GM","Yesterday at 4:20 PM","LETS GO OILERS"

Neat"
"esks123","Today at 9:54 AM","Does anyone know if you have to watch the preseason game ""live"" on Oilers+, or do they keep the full preseason games on demand to watch later?"
"","48 minutes ago","Winnipeg has a live stream of you don’t have Oilers +"
"McAsuno","46 minutes ago","Gonna be there live today for the first preseason game. Hockey is back baby!"
