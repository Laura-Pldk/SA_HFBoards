"BallardEra","Sep 1, 2023","He will be entering his age 38 season. How many goals do you predict for him this season?


Most goals age 38 season:

1. Brett Hull - 37
2. Johnny Bucyk - 31
3. Martin St. Louis - 30
4. Joe Pavelski - 28"
"Winger74","Sep 1, 2023","I hope Ovi will have good season, but hard to predict. There are a lot of factors in play - age, health, performance of his teammates... Optimistic scenario 42 goals, pesimistic 31."
"Zuluss","Sep 1, 2023","Hoping for another 40-goal season, probably his last one.
At the moment, Ovechkin tops the all-time list of 40-goal seasons with 13 (Gretzky has 12, Lemieux and Dionne 10, everyone else 9 or less). Seeing Ovechkin break his own record is always great."
"beowulf","Sep 1, 2023","38 goals"
"User9992","Sep 1, 2023","Hope 40+ once again!"
"eco's bones","Sep 1, 2023","Not much doubt in mind that Alex can put together at least 3/4 more very very productive seasons. Bigger question for me though is if the Caps can get back to the playoffs and I they'll have their work cut out for them and their somewhat aging lineup is going to have to stay healthy or some of their younger kids particularly their forwards are going to have to step up more. It's great that Alex is closing on the NHL goal scoring record (and he seems to stay healthy) but not making it into the postseason really makes for a shitty season. Goaltending might have to be better too."
"","Sep 1, 2023","40 seems about right. 

Of course, it's hockey so there is a wide margin of error."
"deleted user","Sep 1, 2023","Yeah, probably around 27-32."
"Aurinko","Sep 1, 2023","Ill go with 40. I hope this is worth it for Caps.."
"danyhabsfan","Sep 1, 2023","so you predict he'll be injured?

from a 47 goals pace last season to 27-32?"
"RANDOMH3RO","Sep 1, 2023","I’m guessing between 35-45. He missed time last year and still put up 42. 35 should be his absolute floor if he plays a full year."
"Suntouchable13","Sep 1, 2023","51. Why not? His teammates will be looking for him as much as possible."
"Roksta","Sep 1, 2023","I'll go with 51 too"
"Krigsgaldr","Sep 1, 2023","42 goals is my prediction"
"banks","Sep 1, 2023","40 goals is a very attainable number.

Ovie is a machine."
"","Sep 1, 2023","40 at his age has never been done before. It depends on how ass the rest of the team is. If Kuznetsov and Backstrom look like they should be playing beer league at MedStar then I think there’s very little chance. Ovi is a mutant but he’s still human (kind of)."
"","Sep 1, 2023","Who knows, he's a goddamn freak of nature.
Probably 40-50 or something that doesn't make sense for someone his age."
"BallardEra","Sep 1, 2023","He's had some pretty good chemistry with Strome and Carlson being back and healthy would also help on the PP."
"LevelingSolo","Sep 1, 2023","51"
"LevelingSolo","Sep 1, 2023","This is a really good point, the organizations goal now is is the goal record so you'd have to think he'll be getting looks like crazy"
"RRhoads","Sep 1, 2023","If he's healthy and plays all games, I would guess 50."
"BallardEra","Sep 1, 2023","That goes both ways. Over passing to Ovie makes it easier for the opposition as it becomes predictable."
"AhosDatsyukian","Sep 1, 2023","Using other players to predict Ovi goals is a fool's errand. He hits 50+ again this year"
"Suntouchable13","Sep 1, 2023","Plus, I think he will be on the ice every time the opponent has an empty net at the end of the game."
"Regal","Sep 1, 2023","40 hasn’t been done at the same age, but Howe did have 44 at 40 though. Ovechkin’s aging curve is hard to predict. You never know if things will fall off quickly but it doesn’t look like it currently. I think he has another 40 in him. I’ll say he ties Howe for most after age 38 at 44."
"WarriorofTime","Sep 1, 2023","If the Capitals can maintain a middle of the road Powerplay and he stays healthy (I think his missed games last season were primarily due to bereavement) then 40 is definitely obtainable.


He is objectively their best offensive player. So he should be in a position to be ""getting looks like crazy"". All teams should be putting their best offensive players in a position to produce offense. It's not like he should objectively be playing Sonny Milano based on merit right now, but only remains top line, PP1 because of the ""record chase""."
"","Sep 1, 2023","Indeed. Strome had been terrific and was probably their best forward last year not named Ovechkin. The season fell apart when Carlson got hurt.

Still, a 38 year old needs help. It’s not realistic to think he can continue to carry some of these bums around."
"gtrower","Sep 1, 2023","44

Maintains around a .6 gpg pace but takes some maintenance days and misses a few weeks due to injury."
"jigglysquishy","Sep 1, 2023","I'd bet on him breaking the age 38 record."
"CDN24","Sep 1, 2023","He will shoot his age - 38. Not sure how good the Caps will be, he will get a shot at every Empty netter opportunity , but not sure Caps are good enough to be leading by 1 or 2 late in the 3rd in most games."
"Golden_Jet","Sep 1, 2023","40 goals"
"","Sep 1, 2023","I'm going to say at least 36. He shoots at least 12.5% and takes more than 285 shots."
"WarriorofTime","Sep 1, 2023","This is a complete aside, but semi-relevant to the topic. It's impressive that Bret Hull managed 37 goals at age 38 in very a low scoring 2002-03 season. Granted, Detroit itself was not a low scoring team by any means (they scored 14 more goals on the season than than the 2022-23 Capitals for instance), but of course, Hull himself was a big part of that. He was still playing the third most Forward minutes on a contending team (110 points).

Dare I say, he's almost become underrated through the passage of time."
"Faceboner","Sep 1, 2023","One more 50 goal season come on ovi you got this baby"
"EdJovanovski","Sep 1, 2023","74 to break Gretzky's record"
"NewtJorden","Sep 1, 2023","35-40"
"BallardEra","Sep 1, 2023","He's at 822 so 73 to hit 895"
"AvroArrow","Sep 1, 2023","I'll say 41 goals. In the past 10 years (excluding the shortened season) he's hit 40+ and usually 50+ goals. I don't expect him to be much slower than he was last year."
"KingsHockey24","Sep 1, 2023","41, 8 empty netters."
"McShogun99","Sep 1, 2023","52 if he plays close to a full season."
"EdJovanovski","Sep 1, 2023","Oh I must've thought Gretzky had 895 because I kept 895 in my head because that's the number he needs to break the record. He only needs 73 then? 100% happening this szn then"
"Toby91ca","Sep 1, 2023","I mean....that's true....but's it's been done at an older age...Howe had 44 goals at 40 years old.

My prediction.....going out on a limb here: 25-45."
"","Sep 1, 2023","At least 35 if he plays 65+ games."
"Aashir Mallik","Sep 1, 2023","If kuznetsov bounces back, strome keeps his play, and Backstrom can return from the injury then I have him at mid to high 40s

Otherwise I could see as low as mid 30s"
"Conbon","Sep 1, 2023","The entire team is structured around getting Ovi goals. He will hit 40 no doubt in my mind"
"BallardEra","Sep 1, 2023","No it isn't. 

That's the gameplan for the PP though for obvious reasons."
"Jeremy Hronek","Sep 1, 2023","Ovechkin hasn't really played a speed and skill game for the past 5 seasons. He is more about positioning and quality shooting. I don't see him dropping off significantly."
"Karl Eriksson","Sep 1, 2023","I’ll say 30"
"orby","Sep 1, 2023","Around 40 IMO."
"End on a Hinote","Sep 1, 2023","I think he'll surprise a lot, but just narrowly miss 50. 

I say 47."
"Galaxydoggystyle","Sep 1, 2023","55 goals for the great one"
"Despote","Sep 1, 2023","I think he can put in 35 pucks."

"ClasslessGuy","Sep 1, 2023","39"

"HTFN","Sep 1, 2023","This is such an easy thing to say to discredit the guy and team but nobody has ever been able to say .

"Alexander the Gr8","Sep 1, 2023","I’m gonna go with 45 as an optimistic prediction. My actual expectations are 35-40 goals.

"joestevens29","Sep 1, 2023","68"
"Planetov","Sep 1, 2023","The bolded so much. I’ve read far too many hot takes on these boards that confuse Ovie being his team’s best offensive option with the team “trying to get Ovie the record”.

“Getting looks like crazy.” No shit."
"VanillaCoke","Sep 1, 2023","Forty eight"
"","Sep 1, 2023","Interesting that only 37 is the highest at his age.

I think he's got a pretty good shot at beating that.

Just another notch on the belt to show how impressive he is."
"The Panther","Sep 1, 2023","As was noted, Gordie Howe scored 44 goals at age 40, but that was mainly due to mass expansion shortly before. Still very impressive, though. 

The Caps' 20th-place finish in offense last season was their lowest placing since 2006 (though 2011 was close, at 19th). I don't follow the Caps enough to know how good / bad they are, but I think if they're depending on Dylan Strome to be their top center, then they're in for a tough season offensively. And a team struggling to win gets few empty-net opportunities (for Ovi to score).

Still, there's the PP. The Caps maintained a more-or-less League-average PP last season, so if they can do that again, Ovi will get his goals. If he can manage around 14-15 PP goals next season, then even a decline at ES from, say, 28 to 20, would still give him about 35 goals on the season. 

I say, around 35."
"blundluntman","Sep 1, 2023","I’m expecting around 40"
"ReimanSum1908","Sep 1, 2023","I hope that he cracks 40 and sets a new record, because if anyone in the league's history deserves it, Ovy is the man.


I've heard Ovy going by ""the great eight"" which I always held to be a ridiculous and forced nickname, but that was probably in the back of your mind."
"Sempiternal","Sep 1, 2023","41"
"Garbageyuk","Sep 1, 2023","~40 give or take 2 or 3."
"Jeune Poulet","Sep 1, 2023","31.

His time as a 50-goal scorer is definitely over, IMO. And I doubt he will even hit 40 in a season ever again. 

But hitting more than 30 this season is very much within reach and would still be a remarkable achievement at his age, especially considering the roster surrouding him."
"GordonGraham","Sep 1, 2023","Team will be struggling and selling at the deadline so ill go 30"
"Toby91ca","Sep 2, 2023","I’m not sure about the team struggling for wins getting empty opportunities. There is a fair amount of parity in the league, even the bad teams aren’t horrible. The best teams likely won’t have as many opportunities because they’ll be winning by enough not to have the other team pull the goalie. For a team that struggles for wins, you’d think every win is going to be a 1 goal win. I mean…he had a ton of empty net goals last year and they weren’t good"

"Oddbob","Sep 2, 2023","What do you mean rebound? He had 42 just last season. Scoring a few more wouldn't be rebounding at all."

"Klargplutte","Sep 3, 2023","These Ovie threads always leads to one thing, he burns the doubters by roaring back. Healthy Bäckström and Kuzy with a bounce back year will help him past 50+ goals."

"vippe","Sep 3, 2023","If the Caps are a healthy team this year which they werent last year, they make the playoffs and that alone should be an additional motivator outside of the goal record.

"wetcoast","Sep 3, 2023","There was also a huge difference in usage and philosophy for Hull and the Red Wings as Hull was on the ice for 40 of Detroit's 76 PPG.


Washington has had a predictable and middle of the pack PP the last 2 years at some point they will realize that they need better distribution.


Detroit was a similarly older team but way better constructed but ran into a hot goalie in the first round."
"WarriorofTime","Sep 3, 2023","Better distribution how?"

"SeanMoneyHands","Sep 7, 2023","Injuries are catching up to Nik. Still a solid player but Ovy may benefit more with a younger center with faster legs."
"BallardEra","Sep 7, 2023","Him and Strome have clicked pretty well. Maybe Kuznetsov plays with some hunger this year in hopes that he increases his trade value."
"SeanMoneyHands","Sep 7, 2023","Kuznetsov asked for a trade last year. He doesn't want to be there, I would trade him to Nashville, there's the Trotz and Kuznetsov connection.

Strome is a decent center for Ovy, too bad they can't sign someone like Pat Kane to play with Ovy."
"HTFN","Sep 7, 2023","Laviolette was a huge part of that, even though nobody seems to really talk about it. Kuznetsov isn't the only player that lost all the life left in him playing miserable hockey last year, but Kuznetsov especially needs to  some fun to get to that place where he's dominant and boy did the Caps' system just bleed it out of him...

Do I predict anything too positive? Nah, not really, but I don't think it would be a surprise if parts of that wound can be healed by a younger pace-driven coach. At any rate, his options to be traded are basically ""play well enough for someone to want you"" and... well, I don't think there is a second option."
"","Sep 7, 2023","Capitals are terrible with Backstrom and Kuzhetsov being shells of themselves, Ovie can still score some left circle bombs on PP, but I don’t see serious offensive support for him on the current Caps team"
