-Starting in 2024 NCAA football is going to look significantly different. And will introduce a 4 round playoff. It is expected to dominate the sports landscape from late August to early January.

The PWHL in the United States and to a lesser extent in Canada needed to beat that

-The NBA introduced their in-season tournament this year. With tweaks, it will return next year and possibly be bigger and get more attention. It operates from October to December.

The PWHL in the States and to a minor extent in Canada needed to beat that

-The 2024/2025 WJC is in Ottawa

It's really weak and it tears a huge hole in the fabric of society.

You want Trump examples?

Per Trump, immigrants are ""poisoning the blood of our country."" That's a quote from this year.

A little further back in time, a group in Charlottesville gathered to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee. Another group of counter-protesters gatheres. An individual drove their car into the counter-protesters, killing one and injuring many. At the risk of criticizing his Confederation-loving supporters, his statement was that ""I think there was blame on both sides.""

And I could dig up everything about Trump not accepting black residents in his NYC apartment complexes in 1980s and 1990s.

On Biden's opposition to the USA's bussing program, sure, most opposition came from white parents who didn't want black students bussed to their schools, aligning that position with racist attitudes. Biden's response to that was he opposed federal mandates of programs that should be managed locally, at the level where racial segregation by neighbourhoods was understood and could be more well-administered.

"Jan 9, 2024","three suggestions for the PWHL

1) consider a 16 minute period, 48 minute game. This will shrink ice time and keep players fresh. That will speed the game up, and introduce less scramble. Scramble hurts the women's game, it comes off as being house league hockey. 

the success of women's soccer (Football) is in its finesse and in its peed. The game as played in England (WSL) is predicated on wingbacks and traditional wing players. That has meant head-maning (womaning) the ball. Their lack of strength, hinders the lateral passing of the ball from side line to side line. It forces the game to be played up and down.

2) reduce to 48 minutes and you reduce ice time for the 4th lines and the 3rd D pair. this will ensure that the more talented 9 F and 4 D play the bulk of teh minutes. This will elevate play and provide consistent ""star power"" on the ice

3) This will get me into trouble, but here goes.... TV announcers and colour commentator need to have DEEP voices. Soprano voices screech and are difficult to listen to. And it comes off as teenage boys or girls.

Go find women with deep voices... or use AI to alter their voice to a deep voice.

We criticize Dean and Gord, but their voices are easy to listen to.. As is Dan Shulman.. As is Joe Buck (Although he can screech sometime) as is Troy Aikman and so on. Danny Gallivan had a deep voice.

I rarely see a corporation that will trash Trump and Biden...or compliment Trump and Biden. It's one or the other and it's always war!

I rarely come into discussion with an American who changes his vote based on the recent platforms released. It's always engrained that they will be voting for a specific party or leader regardless of what they're saying or doing.

Americans are very divided because you get your yeehaw cowboy conservative Texan who will never admit to the good of social programs, and then you'll have a soy boy soft hippy from California who will never admit the good of capitalism and the needs of the tough industry.

There never seems to be that reasonable middle ground where everyone gets along and can share opinions.

I just thought it was funny that a women's hockey league discussion was headed to the way of bashing or praising Trump.

Trump has literally nothing to do with this women's league.

So it reminds me of the comment sections with Americans. A company will raise the price of cereal and instead of talking about costs of goods or transportation or profits, it becomes a shit slinging contest about Trump or Biden.

"Jan 9, 2024","I’m not a defender of DJT, but can see the MSM spin when it’s so obvious.

And yes, spin happens both ways, no matter the news source…. They’re bias on both sides


If you read the full comment, about illegal immigrants entering illegally into the USA, bringing Fentanyl with them, that accounts for roughly 10k overdose deaths per year…. Yes that is poisoning America…and of course the MSM takes part of the comment out of context and spins it to fit their anti Trump narrative…..

maybe you’re trying to spin “blame on both sides” as being racist, but you’d have show the racial make up of both sides to make your case.


When accused of racial discrimination in the mid 70s, re apartments, DJT claimed “What we didn’t do was rent to welfare cases, white or black,"" in his 1987 book…..no charges were laid….but again this is MSM spin.

The Trumps and their company entered into a consent decree, settling the unfounded racial discrimination litigation in 1975. The agreement contained no admission of wrongdoing, but required the Trump firm to institute a series of safeguards to make sure apartments were rented without regard to race, color, religion, sex or national origin.


Biden is always playing racial politics

He said presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney would ""put you all back in chains"" by unshackling Wall Street.

in ""1977: Biden Said Integrating Black Students Would Turn Schools into ‘A Jungle… A Racial Jungle. I don't want my children to grow up in a jungle, a racial jungle.""

Biden famously quoted in the New York Observer, when talking about Obama “I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy. I mean, that’s a storybook, man.”… this was seen as racist at the time.


Biden, during an interview with Charlemagne tha god, said. ""I'll tell you, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or for Trump, then you ain't black.""


Biden also played the racial stereotype card when he said ""And by the way, what you all know but most people don't know, unlike the African American community with notable exceptions, the Latino community is an incredibly diverse community with incredibly different attitudes about different things. You go to Florida you find a very different attitude about immigration in certain places than you do when you're in Arizona. So it's a very different, a very diverse community,"" 

Biden, who has faced criticism in the past over comments he made about working with segregationists, gave the eulogy for Senator Robert Byrd at his funeral in 2010. ""Bishop, Reverend Clergy, Mona and Marjorie, the entire Byrd family—if you didn't already know it, it's pretty clear the incredible esteem your father was held in,"" Byrd was a Known member of the KKK.

"Jan 10, 2024","In terms of the game itself, I am interested to see how the body contact/body checking rules evolve. Right now, this is officially a non-body checking league, but the truth is that they are largely letting it fly. I'm all for that - these are skilled players, and I think that saddling them with a no body checking league is kind of insulting. No surprise that the rule book is being stretched hugely on this, but that isn't viable long term - eventually they are going to have to codify what is allowed and what isn't. In the meantime, I heard Cheryl Pounder saying that she would have loved to have played in an era where this kind of physical play was allowed - why do I get the sense that Pounder would have given you an elbow to the chops without a second of hesitation? ;-)","Larionov"
"Jan 10, 2024","She also said that the kind of contact being allowed is only along the boards, and not with any big closing velocity.

You're right, the PWHL rule book has to be updated to allow the kind of contact that's been allowed. Rule 52 currently mirrors the IIHF rules for women's hockey.



It should be updated to allow checks along the boards to involve body contact. I expect they'll assess injury rates after this period of informal checking allowance.

However, women are more succeptible to concussions and recover more slowly from them. I don't think we'll see them adopt the same standard as men's hockey.","Flamingo"
"Jan 10, 2024","Players who have not spent almost 10 years playing a game with physical contact, cannot be asked to do so later on.

Women's hockey does not allow contact at any level.. So to ask 19-35 year old women to start being physical will not work well.

It will mean that they will forget about the puck and focus on hitting, or protecting from being hit.

Go watch 13 year olds in their first year of contact hockey.. the puck can be left out.. it can sit peacefully in the middle of the ice. The players are either running around looking to kill each other.. or hiding so that they don't get killed.

and sticks are either defensive weapons, or tools for bludgeoning.

This has to be handled properly. They need to work with the IIHF and see about adding physicality to the women's game for younger aged women/girl's.

the early euphoria about the physical play will be replaced by problems in a few games.. Some player, panicked in fear will use her stick as a weapon!!! And it won't be long before elbows go up and head shots.","Beech"
"Jan 10, 2024","The amount of physical contact we've seen permitted in the PWHL matches what some districts have allowed in girl's competitive hockey for the past 20 years. I.e., at tournaments in Toronto, it seemed a lot more hitting was allowed than in Ottawa. American districts all varied too.

And this type of contact is just a small level of physical engagement up from checking without body contact, but still trying to gain body position advantage on the puck or rub out on the boards, which have always been allowed.

I don't expect them to add open-ice hitting or hitting where the checker closes in on the puck carrier with a large speed differential. That's would be the kind of hitting where predatory hits can really surprise players that aren't conditioned to it.","Flamingo"

Definitely different to international women's hockey, which is what most people will only have seen (myself included).

I really like that they built this team with some international flavour. Two from Czechia, one from Japan, Hungary, Germany. For reference Toronto doesn't have anyone outside North America. There's a European market to tap into, so hopefully the trend continues.","Karl Prime"

"Jan 18, 2024","hey Flame,

1) what is the agreement on the arena? Are they simply renters? or is there a business arrangement that involves ownership?

the reason I ask is: seeing the 67's logo at center ice is poor... It should be PWHL or Ottawa PWHL.. Is there a chance that their logo gets added in a prominent way..

2) how much do you think it costs to remove and reapply ice?

I keep wondering if the PWHL should pay to have new ice put in, with their logo added.. so you leave the 67's and all the other 5 arena logos, but add yours somewhere prominent

3) they need to hit the government up for some cash and re-paint the boards.. puck marks make it look like ""junior hockey"".. They need to re-paint once a month... so, they would need 6 or more copies of each stick on advertising and the staff and the special paint.. it would cost a few bucks.

Presentation is everything.... It is the one area that I think Gary Bettman beats all Commissioners in.. He know how to present.","Beech"
"Jan 18, 2024","Beech, I don't know anything about the bizzznezzzz side of the team. I agree, they should play on an ice surface with their crest under center ice. They don't have a crest yet, and this season was started as a rush. I hope they get that all sorted for next season.

And clean boards? I think advertisers will take care of that. Whether they're painted on, or added by the broadcast, they'd want a clean palette. Hopefully the Alerts and 67s, being two tenants of the same facility, raise the profile and condition of TD Place arena.","Flamingo"

"Jan 24, 2024","PWHL are just tenants in that building, whereas the 67's are owned by the group (OSEG) that manages the building. Zero chance that they are getting their logo at centre ice, unfortunately. You literally have to melt the ice to apply and reapply those logos, and painting them is a very painstaking process.","Larionov"

"Jan 25, 2024","We sucked in the first, had a great second and a good third. Shit turnover right at the end, you got to be playing up the boards in the last minute or so, no high-risk passing through the center of the ice in your zone.

Ottawa is a good team, and they don't really have anything in the way of star power either, so we can hopefully stay consistent as we don't rely on any one player or line.","caymanmew"

I think I get why it happened, though - there is a renewed emphasis in hockey now on making skilled plays and in not just banging it off the glass and out. In the NHL, of course, coaches are going to drill players hard on always making the safe play, but at any level that isn't the NHL, men or women, it doesn't surprise me that someone didn't give a second thought to making a high risk play late in a tie game. Hey, if it works, they are off to the races with numbers, and maybe score the winner themselves...","Larionov"
"Jan 26, 2024","trade proposal
2024 first round pick for Renata Fast from Toronto
she is 29, so has 3 more good years. A right handed Dwomen and speed to burn. It will give the team 3 righties

Sadly, age (33) and giving birth, may have finished Natalie Spooner.. She looks lumbering out there. This league is 3-4 years too late for her..","Beech"
"Jan 27, 2024","Toronto is in an odd spot, they suck yet built an old team. Picking Larocque second overall instead of taking Muller, and having their 3 starting free agents all be 29/30 yet not producing is a major problem.

Spooner, despite her age, is probably their best player. At least she is the one I notice as most threatening when we play against them.

I'd do the trade, but I don't think Toronto will accept trying to rebuild given the overall age of the team they have. More likely they just accept this as a bad year, get the first pick for Fillier (I think she is in the next draft?) and hope that fixes their problems.","caymanmew"

"Feb 8, 2024","I suspect decently far actually. She is fun to watch, and creates a lot of chances, mostly for herself, but she isn't actually producing. If she can start converting chances or otherwise contributing to goals for, I see a spot, otherwise, I am not so sure. I'd like to see her have a shot either way, as she does have a positive effect while on the ice, but without increased point production I don't think they will. She is a top 6 type of player, so they need to give her that type of role to succeed. 

I do think the selection process is fairly biased, and cutting(not selecting) certain players is not something considered. We see this with other women's sports (Soccer) where the national teams are generally kept together and club performances are used more to fill openings than pick the roster.

Watching every game for Ottawa so far, I have found myself somewhat underwhelmed with some of our / the US's national team players when comparing them to others on the team who are not on our (or the US's) national team.","caymanmew"

PWHL Ottawa made two deals before Monday’s trade deadline.

In the first deal, Ottawa acquired forward Tereza Vanišová from PWHL Montreal in exchange for defender Amanda Boulier.


Next, Ottawa acquired forward Shiann Darkangelo from PWHL Boston in exchange for forward Lexie Adzija and the rights to forward Caitrin Lonergan.

Both deals were approved ahead of the 4 p.m. ET deadline.

Vanišová, 28, has two goals and eight assists in 17 games for Montreal this season. She was selected in the seventh round of the PWHL Draft.


Boulier was Ottawa’s 13th-round selection in the PWHL draft. The 30-year-old has registered one goal and five assists in 17 games this season.

Darkangelo, who joins Ottawa along with Vanišová, had recorded one assist in 17 games for Boston this season.

Adzija, 23, heads to Boston after scoring five goals and dishing out three assists with Ottawa. Boston also acquired the rights to Lonergan, who is not signed by a team, but is a two-time Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award finalist which is handed out to the top female college hockey player.

In the inaugural PWHL season, Montreal sits third with 30 points, while Boston sits fourth (22 points) and Ottawa in fifth (21 points).","mianjo"
